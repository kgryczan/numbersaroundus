    "text": "Why Interactive Tables Matter\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nWhen people think of tables, they often picture static rows and columns, a no-frills way to present data. But interactive tables are a whole different story! These tables let users engage with the data directly, exploring it in ways that feel almost hands-on. Adding features like sorting, filtering, and searching transforms a simple table into a dynamic tool where readers can make their own discoveries.\nSo, why use interactive tables? Imagine you’re building a report for a large dataset. Instead of bogging down readers with endless rows and columns, you can let them filter out what they need or sort by their specific interests. For data professionals, this level of flexibility is invaluable — it allows anyone to find exactly what they’re looking for, without having to navigate through a mountain of data.\nIn this article, we’ll explore how R can help us create interactive tables across different contexts: from dashboards and reports to interactive web apps. With R’s powerful packages, like DT and reactable, you can bring tables to life with just a few lines of code. Let’s get started with the basics and work our way to some advanced features!\n\n\nGetting Started with DT: DataTables in R\nWhen it comes to building interactive tables in R, the DT package is a fantastic place to start. Developed as an interface to JavaScript’s DataTables library, DT enables you to quickly add interactive features to your tables without complex coding. This means you can create tables that support sorting, filtering, and navigating large datasets—all with minimal setup. Whether you’re designing a report, building a dashboard, or creating a web app, DT offers functionality that transforms static tables into dynamic data exploration tools.\nOne of the main appeals of DT is its ease of use. To get started, simply pass your dataset to DT::datatable(), and with just that, you’ll have a table that:\n\nSorts each column by clicking the column header, allowing users to view data in their preferred order.\nSearches through all table content with a convenient search box above the table, so users can instantly locate specific information.\nPaginates large datasets, displaying a specified number of rows per page, making it easy to navigate through hundreds or thousands of rows without scrolling endlessly.\n\nTo see this in action, here’s a basic example using R’s built-in iris dataset. In this example, we’re creating a table that displays five rows per page:\nlibrary(DT)\n# Creating a basic interactive table\ndatatable(iris, options = list(pageLength = 5, autoWidth = TRUE))\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn this code:\n\npageLength = 5 sets the number of rows visible at once to five, which is especially useful for datasets with many rows. This setting allows users to page through rows smoothly without feeling overwhelmed by the data.\nautoWidth = TRUE automatically adjusts column widths based on the data content, ensuring your table looks clean and well-organized.\n\nThis single line of code provides a fully interactive table that you can integrate into HTML-based documents, Shiny apps, or R Markdown reports. The table is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and functional. With DT, you can create a data table that allows users to explore your dataset directly and efficiently, all without having to build custom interfaces or write extensive JavaScript.\n\n\nCustomizing Tables in DT: More Control and Style\nThe basic setup for DT tables is functional and simple, but if you want your tables to truly shine, DT offers a wealth of customization options. These let you adjust not only the appearance but also the interactivity of your tables, giving users more control over how they explore the data. Customization can be especially useful for tailored reports or web-based dashboards where readers may have specific needs, such as filtering by certain values or only viewing select columns.\n\nAdding Individual Column Filters\nIn many cases, a global search box is helpful, but if users need to filter specific columns independently, individual column filters make a big difference. For example, imagine you’re working with a dataset like iris, where users might want to see only rows with Sepal.Length above 5 or filter Species to show only specific categories. With DT, you can easily add filters for each column.\nHere’s how to enable individual column filters:\ndatatable(iris, filter = \"top\", options = list(pageLength = 5))\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nBy setting filter = \"top\", DT automatically places a filter box at the top of each column, giving users the flexibility to search for values independently. This feature can be particularly useful when working with larger datasets where users need to narrow down rows by specific values or ranges, allowing them to:\n\nFilter categorical data: Users can select one or more categories (e.g., filtering Species for “setosa” or “versicolor”).\nFilter numeric data: Users can set numeric filters (e.g., showing only rows where Sepal.Width is greater than 3).\nSearch by partial matches: This can be helpful when columns contain text or unique identifiers.\n\nThese individual filters empower readers to explore data without cluttering the main table view. Instead of having to scan through all rows, users can focus on the exact data points they need, making for a highly personalized viewing experience.\n\n\nAdjusting Page Length and Table Layout\nWhen you’re working with large datasets, adjusting the page length — or the number of rows visible at once — improves readability and reduces scrolling. While displaying 5 rows per page works for smaller tables, larger datasets often benefit from showing more rows per page (e.g., 10 or 15), allowing users to view more data at a glance without extensive paging. You can set the page length to fit the specific needs of your project.\nThe layout, including table width and column visibility, can also affect readability. DT gives you control over layout settings through the dom parameter. This parameter specifies which elements (buttons, filters, search bars, etc.) are visible. Here’s how to adjust both page length and layout options:\ndatatable(\n  iris, \n  extensions = 'Buttons', # Enable the Buttons extension\n  options = list(\n    pageLength = 10,\n    dom = 'Bfrtip',\n    autoWidth = TRUE,\n    buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print') # Specify the types of buttons\n  )\n)\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn this example:\n\npageLength = 10 displays 10 rows at a time, making it easier to view more data per page.\ndom = 'Bfrtip' customizes the toolbar layout. Each letter represents a different component:\n\nB: Buttons (for exporting or downloading data)\nf: Filter (the search bar)\nr: Processing indicator (useful for larger tables)\nt: Table itself\np: Pagination (for navigating pages)\n\n\nThis dom setting lets you control exactly which table features appear on the page, simplifying the view for readers. For example, if you’re using the table in a Shiny app and only need the table and pagination features, you could set dom = 'tp', which hides the search bar and toolbar to give a more streamlined look.\n\nautoWidth = TRUE automatically adjusts column widths to fit the content, which helps maintain a clean, proportional look without columns being too cramped or stretched.\nbuttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print'): This argument specifies which export options to show in the toolbar.\n\n\n\nAdding Styling and Conditional Formatting\nIn addition to adjusting layout, DT allows you to style your tables to improve readability and focus attention on key values. For example, you may want to highlight high values in a “price” column, or use color to differentiate specific categories. DT supports conditional formatting using the formatStyle() function, which allows you to apply styles to individual cells based on conditions.\nHere’s how you could apply conditional formatting to highlight values in the Sepal.Length column that exceed a certain threshold:\ndatatable(iris, options = list(pageLength = 10)) %&gt;%\n  formatStyle(\n    'Sepal.Length',\n    backgroundColor = styleInterval(5.5, c('white', 'lightgreen'))\n  )\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn this example:\n\nstyleInterval() sets intervals for conditional formatting. Here, all values in Sepal.Length above 5.5 will have a light green background, while values below remain white.\nThis type of formatting is particularly useful when you want to make certain data stand out. For instance, highlighting high or low values in financial data, differentiating categories by color, or adding visual cues for outliers.\n\nConditional formatting and custom styling give your tables an added layer of professionalism, especially useful in reports or presentations where certain data points need emphasis.\nThese customization options within DT allow you to tailor the look, feel, and functionality of your tables, ensuring that readers can navigate and interpret the data effectively. Whether you’re fine-tuning pagination, adding individual filters, or applying styling for impact, DT offers plenty of ways to enhance both usability and aesthetics.\n\n\n\nreactable: Creating Stylish Interactive Tables\nWhile DT is a fantastic choice for basic interactive tables, reactable takes customization to a new level, allowing for highly flexible and visually polished tables. Built on React, reactable provides rich interactivity and seamless customization, including column-specific settings, themes, and row expansions. If you’re creating tables for dashboards, reports, or any application that demands a bit more styling, reactable is a powerful tool to have.\nWith reactable, you can go beyond standard data displays by adding custom formats, colors, and even mini visualizations. Let’s start by creating a basic reactable table with the iris dataset and then dive into some customization options.\n\nCreating a Basic reactable Table\nHere’s a quick example of a basic interactive table using reactable:\nlibrary(reactable)\n\n# Basic reactable table with iris dataset\nreactable(iris, columns = list(\n  Sepal.Length = colDef(name = \"Sepal Length\"),\n  Sepal.Width = colDef(name = \"Sepal Width\"),\n  Petal.Length = colDef(name = \"Petal Length\"),\n  Petal.Width = colDef(name = \"Petal Width\"),\n  Species = colDef(name = \"Species\")\n))\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn this code:\n\ncolDef() customizes each column with more readable names.\nThis setup gives you a clean, sortable table that lets users click column headers to sort data. The columns are also resizable by default, providing flexibility for users to adjust the view.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Customization with colDef\nOne of the best features of reactable is the ability to define column-specific settings through colDef(), where you can set custom formatting, alignment, background colors, and even icons based on cell values. This makes it easy to highlight certain data points or apply thematic styling to fit your application’s design.\nLet’s add a few customizations to the reactable table:\n\nWe’ll style Species cells to include icons.\nFormat Sepal.Length to two decimal places with color indicators.\n\nreactable(iris, columns = list(\n  Sepal.Length = colDef(\n    name = \"Sepal Length\",\n    align = \"center\",\n    cell = function(value) {\n      if (value &gt; 5) paste0(\"🌱 \", round(value, 2)) else round(value, 2)\n    },\n    style = function(value) {\n      if (value &gt; 5) list(color = \"green\") else list(color = \"black\")\n    }\n  ),\n  Species = colDef(\n    cell = function(value) {\n      if (value == \"setosa\") \"🌸 Setosa\" else value\n    },\n    align = \"center\"\n  )\n))\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn this code:\n\nCustom Cell Content: In Sepal.Length, cells with values greater than 5 are prefixed with a small plant icon 🌱 and styled in green.\nIcons in Text Cells: For Species, we add a flower icon 🌸 for “setosa” values, making it more visually distinct.\nAlignment: By setting align = \"center\", we ensure that the values appear centered in each cell, creating a cleaner look.\n\n\n\nApplying Themes and Styling\nreactable also comes with several built-in themes, or you can create your own custom styles using CSS to match any design you’re working with. Here’s an example of how to apply the “compact” theme with striped rows, which gives your table a sleek, modern look:\nreactable(\n  iris[1:30, ],\n  searchable = TRUE,\n  striped = TRUE,\n  highlight = TRUE,\n  bordered = TRUE,\n  theme = reactableTheme(\n    borderColor = \"#dfe2e5\",\n    stripedColor = \"#f6f8fa\",\n    highlightColor = \"#fff000\",\n    cellPadding = \"8px 12px\",\n    style = list(fontFamily = \"-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\"),\n    searchInputStyle = list(width = \"100%\")\n  )\n)\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nThis example adds:\n\nStriped Rows: Alternating row colors make it easier to read across large datasets.\nHighlighting: Selected rows are highlighted to improve navigation.\nCompact Layout: Reduces padding for a more compressed view, ideal for tables with many rows.\n\nWith reactable, you have flexibility over everything from themes and icons to row expandability. The package is particularly suited for dashboards, apps, and reports where style and interactivity are both high priorities.\n\n\n\nIntegrating Interactive Tables in Shiny\nInteractive tables become even more powerful in the context of Shiny apps, where they can respond to user inputs in real-time. By integrating tables from DT or reactable into a Shiny app, you can allow users to filter, sort, and explore data while responding to additional controls, like sliders or dropdowns. This flexibility makes Shiny ideal for creating dashboards, reports, or custom data exploration tools.\n\nCreating a Basic Shiny App with DT\nLet’s start with a simple Shiny app that uses DT to display an interactive table. In this example, we’ll use a slider to allow users to filter rows based on Sepal Length from the iris dataset:\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(DT)\n\n# Define the UI\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"Iris Dataset Interactive Table\"),\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      sliderInput(\"sepal\", \"Filter by Sepal Length:\",\n                  min = min(iris$Sepal.Length), max = max(iris$Sepal.Length), \n                  value = c(min(iris$Sepal.Length), max(iris$Sepal.Length)))\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      DTOutput(\"table\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define the server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  output$table &lt;- renderDT({\n    # Filter the data based on slider input\n    filtered_data &lt;- iris[iris$Sepal.Length &gt;= input$sepal[1] & iris$Sepal.Length &lt;= input$sepal[2], ]\n    datatable(filtered_data, options = list(pageLength = 5))\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application \nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn this example:\n\nSlider Input: The sliderInput in the UI allows users to filter the table by Sepal Length values. The slider is set to the range of Sepal Length in the dataset, so users can choose any range within those values.\nFiltering Data in Server: In the server function, we filter iris based on the slider values and then render the filtered table using renderDT().\nTable Output: DTOutput displays the filtered table in the main panel, showing 5 rows per page.\n\nThis basic Shiny app provides users with control over what they see, allowing them to explore the dataset interactively with the filter.\n\n\nUsing reactable for Customization in Shiny\nIf you want even more control over the table’s appearance and functionality, you can use reactable in your Shiny app. Here’s an example of a similar Shiny app with reactable, where we add an input for selecting specific Species to filter by:\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(reactable)\n\n# Define the UI\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"Interactive Table with reactable\"),\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"species\", \"Select Species:\", \n                  choices = c(\"All\", unique(as.character(iris$Species)))),\n      sliderInput(\"sepal\", \"Filter by Sepal Length:\",\n                  min = min(iris$Sepal.Length), max = max(iris$Sepal.Length), \n                  value = c(min(iris$Sepal.Length), max(iris$Sepal.Length)))\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      reactableOutput(\"reactable_table\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define the server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  output$reactable_table &lt;- renderReactable({\n    # Filter data based on user inputs\n    filtered_data &lt;- iris[iris$Sepal.Length &gt;= input$sepal[1] & iris$Sepal.Length &lt;= input$sepal[2], ]\n    if (input$species != \"All\") {\n      filtered_data &lt;- filtered_data[filtered_data$Species == input$species, ]\n    }\n    \n    # Render the reactable table\n    reactable(filtered_data, \n              columns = list(\n                Sepal.Length = colDef(name = \"Sepal Length\"),\n                Sepal.Width = colDef(name = \"Sepal Width\"),\n                Petal.Length = colDef(name = \"Petal Length\"),\n                Petal.Width = colDef(name = \"Petal Width\"),\n                Species = colDef(name = \"Species\")\n              ),\n              striped = TRUE, highlight = TRUE)\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application \nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\nIn this enhanced version:\n\nSpecies Filter: The selectInput lets users choose a specific species or view all species in the table. This input is especially useful for focusing on subsets within categorical data.\nSlider and Select Filter Combination: We filter by Sepal Length range and Species, providing two levels of control over what users see.\nreactable Styling: striped = TRUE and highlight = TRUE options add styling to make the table easier to read and navigate.\n\nWith reactable in Shiny, users get a polished table with styling and functionality that can adapt dynamically to any dataset they’re exploring.\n\n\n\nEnhancing Tables with Advanced Extensions\nNow that we’ve covered interactivity, let’s take a look at some tricky extensions that can add advanced customization, small in-table visualizations, and complex formatting to your tables. While they may not add interactivity in the same way as DT or reactable, these packages help you create visually stunning tables that can make your data come alive in reports and presentations. Here’s a rundown of some of the best tools for taking your tables from basic to brilliant.\n\nkableExtra: Advanced Formatting for Markdown Tables\nIf you’re using knitr::kable() to create tables in R Markdown, kableExtra is a perfect companion. It provides advanced styling options to add borders, bold headers, row grouping, and even color coding, making your tables far more visually appealing and readable.\nExample: Creating a Styled Table with kableExtra\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn this example:\n\nkable_styling() adds bootstrap options to apply striping, hovering, and condensed spacing.\nrow_spec() makes the header row bold, with a custom color and background, drawing the reader’s attention to column titles.\ncolumn_spec() applies bold formatting to the first column to distinguish it visually.\nadd_header_above() creates a merged header spanning multiple columns.\n\n\n\ngtExtras: Adding Visuals to gt Tables\nIf you’re using gt for creating high-quality tables, gtExtras can help you take it to the next level. This extension enables you to add sparklines, bar charts, lollipop charts, and other mini visualizations directly within cells. It’s a great way to add trend data, comparisons, or distribution insights to your tables without relying on external plots.\nExample: Adding Sparklines and Mini Bar Charts with gtExtras\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(gtExtras)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Prepare example data with a trend for each row\niris_summary &lt;- iris %&gt;%\n  group_by(Species) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    Avg_Sepal_Length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n    Sepal_Length_Trend = list(sample(4:8, 10, replace = TRUE))\n  )\n\n# Create a gt table with sparklines for trends\ngt(iris_summary) %&gt;%\n  gt_plt_sparkline(Sepal_Length_Trend) %&gt;%\n  tab_header(title = \"Iris Species Summary\", subtitle = \"Including Sepal Length Trends\")\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn this example:\n\ngt_plt_sparkline() adds a sparkline within the Sepal_Length_Trend column, showing trends for each species.\ntab_header() provides a title and subtitle for context.\n\nWith gtExtras, your tables can communicate more than just static data — they can tell a story by visually showcasing trends and distributions right in the table cells.\n\n\nformattable: In-Cell Visualizations for DataFrames\nThe formattable package is another powerful tool for creating visually enhanced tables, particularly useful for adding color-coded scales, bars, and visual indicators based on cell values. It’s designed to help you visualize comparisons directly within a data.frame, making it ideal for quick dashboards or reports.\nExample: Adding Color Scales and Mini Bars with formattable\nlibrary(formattable)\n\n# Create a formattable table with in-cell color scales and bars\nformattable(\n  iris,\n  list(\n    Sepal.Length = color_tile(\"lightblue\", \"lightgreen\"),\n    Sepal.Width = color_bar(\"pink\"),\n    Petal.Length = formatter(\"span\", \n                             style = x ~ style(font.weight = \"bold\", color = ifelse(x &gt; 4, \"red\", \"black\")))\n  )\n)\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn this example:\n\ncolor_tile() applies a background color gradient to Sepal.Length, making it easy to compare values visually.\ncolor_bar() adds a color bar in Sepal.Width cells, giving a quick visual cue of relative size.\nformatter() applies conditional font styling to Petal.Length, highlighting values above a threshold in red.\n\n\n\nflextable: Creating Word and PowerPoint-Compatible Tables\nFor reports destined for Word or PowerPoint, flextable is a robust choice, offering rich customization options that ensure your tables look polished in these formats. With flextable, you can merge cells, add images, and apply various themes, making it a go-to option for tables that need to be embedded in professional documents.\nExample: Customizing a Table for Word with flextable\nlibrary(flextable)\n\n# Create a flextable with merged headers and styling\nft &lt;- flextable(head(iris))\nft &lt;- set_header_labels(ft, Sepal.Length = \"Sepal Length\", Sepal.Width = \"Sepal Width\")\nft &lt;- add_header_row(ft, values = c(\"Flower Measurements\"), colspan = 4)\nft &lt;- theme_vanilla(ft)\nft &lt;- autofit(ft)\n\n# Save to Word\n# save_as_docx(ft, path = \"iris_table.docx\")\nft\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nEach of these packages offers unique strengths for customizing tables, making them valuable tools for any R user aiming to create more engaging, insightful, and visually appealing tables. Whether you’re building tables with in-cell visualizations, integrating trends with sparklines, or creating print-ready documents, these extensions let you go beyond basics and add a professional polish to your work.\n\n\n\nBringing Data to Life with Interactive and Enhanced Tables\nTables may seem simple, but they’re one of the most powerful tools for data communication. In this article, we’ve explored how to transform tables from static rows and columns into dynamic, interactive tools using R’s DT and reactable packages. Whether in a Shiny app or a standalone report, these tables allow readers to explore, filter, and engage with data in real-time, making data insights accessible to everyone.\nAnd when interactivity isn’t needed, we’ve looked at advanced table extensions like kableExtra, gtExtras, formattable, and flextable, which bring tables to life with beautiful formatting, in-cell visualizations, and high-quality styling options. These tools ensure your tables aren’t just functional—they’re visually compelling and professionally polished.\nBy combining interactivity with powerful formatting extensions, you have everything you need to craft tables that both captivate and communicate effectively. Now, you’re ready to bring data to life, one table at a time!"

    "text": "Embracing the Tidyverse Style Guide\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nHey there, fellow R coder! When it comes to writing code in R, making it functional is just the beginning. Trust me, I’ve been there — debugging code at 2 AM, wondering what I was thinking when I wrote that line. This is where the Tidyverse Style Guide comes to the rescue, transforming your functional code into a masterpiece of readability and maintainability.\n\n\nWhy Coding Style Matters\nImagine reading a book with no punctuation or structure. Nightmare, right? The same goes for code. Good coding style ensures that your future self and your colleagues can comprehend and extend your work. As they say, “Today I know and God knows, but in a week only God will know how this should work.”\n\n\nFiles and Directories\n\nFile Naming Conventions\nProper file naming is crucial. Imagine rummaging through a folder named “folder2” — frustrating, right? Descriptive, meaningful names make it easier for others to understand the purpose of each file at a glance.\nGood Example:\ndata_analysis.R\nBad Example:\nData Analysis.R\nPros: Clear, concise, and consistent naming conventions make files easy to understand and manage, enhancing collaboration and avoiding issues with operating systems.\nCons: Inconsistent naming can lead to confusion, errors, and inefficiencies in managing and collaborating on projects.\n\n\nDirectory Structure\nA well-organized directory structure helps in navigating the project efficiently. It separates data, scripts, and results, making it easier to locate and manage files.\nGood Example:\nproject/\n├── data/\n├── scripts/\n└── results/\nBad Example:\nproject/\n├── folder1/\n├── folder2/\n└── random_folder/\nPros: A clear directory structure improves readability, navigation, and file management. It enhances collaboration by providing a standardized layout.\nCons: Poor organization leads to confusion, difficulty in finding files, increased errors, and reduced collaboration efficiency.\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\nIndentation and Spacing\nThink of indentation and spacing as the grammar of your code. Proper indentation and spacing make your code more readable and maintainable. The tidyverse style guide recommends using two spaces per indentation level and avoiding tabs.\nGood Example:\nif (condition) {\n  do_something()\n}\nBad Example:\nif(condition){\ndo_something()}\nPros: Using consistent indentation and spacing enhances readability and ensures that your code looks clean and professional. It makes it easier for others to follow your logic.\nCons: Inconsistent indentation makes the code hard to read and understand, leading to potential errors and misinterpretations.\n\n\nLine Length and Breaks\nKeeping lines under 80 characters and breaking lines after operators improve code readability, especially on smaller screens.\nGood Example:\nmy_function &lt;- function(arg1, arg2) {\n  long_expression &lt;- arg1 + \n    arg2\n  return(long_expression)\n}\nBad Example:\nmy_function &lt;- function(arg1, arg2) {\n  long_expression &lt;- arg1 + arg2\n  return(long_expression)\n}\nPros: Maintaining a maximum line length and breaking lines appropriately makes your code easier to read and prevents horizontal scrolling.\nCons: Ignoring this practice can lead to cramped and hard-to-follow code, making debugging and collaboration more challenging.\n\n\nNaming Conventions\nAdopting consistent naming conventions, such as snake_case for object names and UpperCamelCase for function names, helps in making the code more predictable and easier to understand.\nGood Example:\ndata_frame &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 10:1)\nBad Example:\nDataFrame &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 10:1)\nPros: Consistent naming conventions enhance readability and maintainability by providing a clear and predictable structure to your code. Cons: Inconsistent naming can cause confusion and errors, making it harder for others (and your future self) to understand and work with the code.\n\n\n\nFunctions\n\nWriting Functions\nFunctions should have clear, descriptive names and be designed to perform a single task. This improves readability and maintainability.\nGood Example:\nadd_numbers &lt;- function(a, b) {\n  return(a + b)\n}\nBad Example:\naddnumbers &lt;- function(a,b){return(a+b)}\nPros: Clear, descriptive names and single-task functions make code easier to understand and maintain.\nCons: Ambiguous names and multifunctional code increase complexity, making it harder to debug and extend.\n\n\nFunction Arguments\nUse default arguments where appropriate and document all arguments and return values. This makes functions more flexible and easier to use.\nGood Example:\nplot_data &lt;- function(data, x_col, y_col, color = \"blue\") {\n  plot(data[[x_col]], data[[y_col]], col = color)\n}\nBad Example:\nplot_data &lt;- function(data, x_col, y_col, color) {\n  plot(data[[x_col]], data[[y_col]], col = color)\n}\nPros: Default arguments provide flexibility and make functions easier to use. Proper documentation aids in understanding.\nCons: Lack of defaults and documentation can lead to misuse and confusion.\n\n\nReturn Values\nEnsure functions always return a value and that the return type is consistent. This makes the behavior of functions predictable and easier to debug.\nGood Example:\nadd_numbers &lt;- function(a, b) {\n  return(a + b)\n}\nBad Example:\nadd_numbers &lt;- function(a, b) {\n  result &lt;- a + b\n  # No return statement\n}\nPros: Consistent return values make functions predictable and easier to integrate.\nCons: Inconsistent or missing return values create ambiguity, making debugging and integration challenging.\n\n\n\nPipes\n\nUsing Pipes\nPipes, introduced by the magrittr package and widely used in the tidyverse, streamline code by chaining operations in a readable manner.\nGood Example:\nlibrary(dplyr)\ndata %&gt;%\n  filter(x &gt; 1) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_y = mean(y))\nBad Example:\nlibrary(dplyr)\nsummarise(filter(data, x &gt; 1), mean_y = mean(y))\nPros: Pipes enhance readability by breaking down operations into clear, sequential steps, making complex data transformations easier to follow. Cons: Without pipes, code becomes nested and harder to read, increasing the likelihood of errors and making debugging more difficult.\n\n\nPipe Practices\nTo ensure clarity, avoid performing complex operations within a single pipe chain. Instead, break down steps to maintain readability. This example is little bit exaggerated, because we have only 6 lines, but it is not unusual to have pipe made of 30 or more lines, and this rule should be used in that case.\nGood Example:\ndata_cleaned &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(x)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(z = x + y)\n\nresult &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  group_by(category) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_z = mean(z))\nBad Example:\nresult &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(x)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(z = x + y) %&gt;%\n  group_by(category) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_z = mean(z))\nPros: Breaking down pipe chains improves readability and makes each step understandable and debuggable.\nCons: Long, complex pipes can be difficult to follow and troubleshoot, reducing code clarity and increasing maintenance difficulty.\n\n\n\nggplot2\n\nBreaking Code on Operators\nBreaking code on operators enhances readability and maintains a clean structure. This practice is particularly useful when dealing with long lines of code.\nGood Example:\nggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot\", \n       x = \"X Axis\", \n       y = \"Y Axis\")\nPros: Each operation is on a new line, making the code easier to read and modify.\n\n\nProper Order of Layers\nMaintaining a proper order of layers in ggplot2 ensures that each layer is applied correctly, making the visualization more accurate and aesthetically pleasing.\nGood Example:\nggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  theme_minimal()\nPros: The smoothing layer is applied on top of the points, and the theme is applied last, ensuring a clean and logical structure.\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\nIn-Code Documentation\nIn-code documentation using comments helps others (and your future self) understand the logic and purpose of your code. It’s important to strike a balance between too many and too few comments.\nGood Example:\n# Calculate the mean of a numeric vector\ncalculate_mean &lt;- function(x) {\n  mean(x)\n}\nPros: Provides clear, concise information about the function’s purpose.\n\n\nRoxygen2 for Functions\nUsing Roxygen2 for documenting functions ensures comprehensive, consistent, and machine-readable documentation. This is particularly useful for creating package documentation.\nGood Example:\n#’ Calculate the mean of a numeric vector\n#’\n#’ @param x A numeric vector\n#’ @return The mean of the vector\n#’ @export\ncalculate_mean &lt;- function(x) {\n  mean(x)\n}\nPros: Provides a structured and detailed description, making it easy to generate documentation files automatically.\nGood in-code documentation and comprehensive function documentation using Roxygen2 enhance code readability, usability, and maintainability. Poor documentation leads to confusion, errors, and increased time spent understanding and debugging code.\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous Style Guidelines\n\nAssignment Using &lt;- Not =\nThe assignment operator &lt;- is preferred over = for clarity and consistency in R code.\nGood Example:\nx &lt;- 10\nPros: Clear distinction between assignment and equality checks.\n\n\nProper Spacing\nUsing proper spacing, especially near operators, enhances code readability.\nGood Example:\nresult &lt;- a + b\nPros: Improves readability and reduces errors.\n\n\nAvoiding Reserved Names\nAvoid using reserved names like c, T, or F as variable names to prevent conflicts with built-in functions and constants.\nGood Example:\nvec &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nPros: Avoids conflicts with the c() function.\n\n\nCode Organization\nOrganizing code using empty lines and breaking long lines helps in maintaining a clean and readable structure.\nGood Example:\ncalculate_sum &lt;- function(a, b) {\n  result &lt;- a + b\n  \n  return(result) \n}\nPros: Use of empty lines and line breaks improves readability and structure.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nBy embracing the Tidyverse Style Guide for R coding, you’re not just writing code; you’re crafting a readable, maintainable, and collaborative masterpiece. These guidelines will help you avoid those 2 AM debugging sessions and make your code a joy to work with. Consistent coding style reduces errors, improves project efficiency, and facilitates long-term maintenance. Embrace these guidelines to enhance your coding practices and project success.

By the end of this guide, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to leverage the best of both worlds, crafting documents that stand out for their elegance and precision.\n\n\nPrerequisites and Setup\n\nInstalling RStudio and LaTeX\nBefore we dive into the intricacies of combining LaTeX with R Markdown, let’s ensure you have all the necessary tools installed. RStudio is an indispensable IDE for anyone working with R, and it provides seamless support for R Markdown. LaTeX, on the other hand, is a typesetting system that excels in document preparation, especially for those containing complex mathematical formulas.\n\nRStudio: If you haven’t already, download and install RStudio. Choose the version appropriate for your operating system.\nLaTeX Distribution: For LaTeX, you need a distribution based on your operating system. Windows users can opt for MiKTeX, macOS users for MacTeX, and Linux users for TeX Live. Installation links and instructions are readily available on their respective websites.\n\nAfter installing both RStudio and your LaTeX distribution, ensure that RStudio can locate your LaTeX installation. This integration is typically automatic, but you can verify or adjust the settings in RStudio by navigating to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Sweave.\n\n\nConfiguring RStudio for LaTeX and R Markdown\nWith RStudio and LaTeX installed, the next step is to configure your RStudio environment for an optimal working experience. This involves:\n\nInstalling Necessary R Packages: Open RStudio and install the rmarkdown package, which supports the integration of R code with Markdown (and by extension, LaTeX) for dynamic document generation. Install it by running:\n\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\n\nTesting Your Setup: To confirm everything is set up correctly, create a new R Markdown document. Go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown…, then choose PDF as the output format. This action requires LaTeX for PDF generation, so if it succeeds without errors, your setup is correct.\n\nThis section’s goal is to ensure you have a smooth start with all the necessary tools at your disposal. Once you’re set up, the real fun begins: exploring the synergy between LaTeX and R Markdown to create stunning scientific documents.\n\n\n\nYour First R Markdown Document with LaTeX\nCreating your first R Markdown document integrated with LaTeX in RStudio is a simple yet exciting process. This section will guide you through creating a basic document, adding LaTeX for formatting and equations, and generating a PDF output.\n\nCreating an R Markdown Document\n\nStart a New R Markdown File: In RStudio, go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown… This opens a dialog where you can set the document’s title and output format. For now, select PDF and click OK.\nExplore the Default Content: RStudio will generate a sample document filled with some basic Markdown content and example code chunks. This template serves as an excellent introduction to R Markdown’s capabilities.\n\n\n\nIntegrating Basic LaTeX Elements\nWithin your R Markdown document, you can start integrating LaTeX directly. Here’s how you can add some basic LaTeX commands for text formatting and sections:\nThis is an R Markdown document with \\LaTeX. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to \\LaTeX for high-quality document production.\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThis is a section created using LaTeX.\n\n\\subsection{Background}\nThis subsection provides background information, also formatted using LaTeX.\n\n\\textbf{Bold text} and \\textit{italicized text} can easily be added with LaTeX commands.\n\n\nAdding Mathematical Expressions\nOne of LaTeX’s strengths is its ability to format complex mathematical expressions beautifully. In R Markdown, you can include these expressions by enclosing them in dollar signs for inline equations or double dollar signs for displayed equations:\nHere is an inline equation: \\(E=mc^2\\).\n\nAnd a displayed equation:\n\n$$\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n$$\n\n\nCompiling to PDF\nAfter adding your content, compile the document to PDF by clicking the “Knit” button in RStudio and selecting PDF. RStudio will use LaTeX to process your document, incorporating any LaTeX commands or mathematical expressions you’ve included, and generate a PDF.\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nThis simple exercise demonstrates the power of combining R Markdown’s dynamic capabilities with LaTeX’s typesetting prowess, all within the RStudio environment. Whether you’re documenting research findings, drafting a paper, or preparing a report, this approach allows you to create professional, elegantly formatted documents efficiently.\n\n\n\nAdvanced LaTeX Features in R Markdown\nHaving grasped the basics of integrating LaTeX into R Markdown documents, we’ll now delve into advanced features to further elevate your scientific document’s quality. This segment highlights enhanced figure and table management, utilizing custom LaTeX commands, and effectively handling bibliographies within RStudio.\n\nWorking with Figures and Tables\nLaTeX is renowned for its precise control over figures and tables, but in R Markdown, we approach these elements differently, leveraging Markdown and R code chunks for dynamic content integration and formatting.\nFigures\nFor static images, use Markdown syntax:\n![Caption for the figure.](my_address_to_logo){width=20%}\nFor dynamically generated figures from R:\n{r label, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Caption for the figure.\"}\ndata(mtcars)\nplot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nTables\nTo create detailed and customizable tables in your R Markdown document using LaTeX, you’ll directly use the tabular environment provided by LaTeX. This allows for precise control over the table’s appearance, alignment, and overall structure. Here’s a basic example of creating a table with LaTeX:\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Sample Data Table}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcr}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Left Align} & \\textbf{Center} & \\textbf{Right Align} \\\\\n\\hline\nData 1 & Data 2 & Data 3 \\\\\nMore & Data & Here \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{tab:sample_table}\n\\end{table}\nThis LaTeX code snippet places a table with headers aligned to the left, center, and right. The \\hline command creates horizontal lines for clarity, and \\textbf is used for bold header text. The \\caption{} and \\label{} commands are used for the table’s caption and referencing it in the text, respectively.\n\n\nDefining and Using Custom LaTeX Commands\nYou can define custom LaTeX commands for repetitive tasks or to simplify complex formatting. Custom commands are defined in the YAML header of your R Markdown document using header-includes:\nheader-includes:\n  - \\newcommand{\\highlight}[1]{\\textbf{\\textcolor{red}{#1}}}\nThis command, \\highlight{}, makes specified text bold and red. To use this command within your document:\nThis is regular text and this is \\highlight{highlighted text}.\n\n\nApplying Custom Commands in Tables\nYour custom LaTeX commands can be utilized within tables to emphasize specific pieces of data or apply consistent formatting. Using the previously defined \\highlight{} command:\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Demonstrating Custom Commands in Tables}\n\\begin{tabular}{lc}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Description} & \\textbf{Data} \\\\\n\\hline\nRegular Data & 123 \\\\\nHighlighted Data & \\highlight{456} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{tab:custom_command_table}\n\\end{table}\nThis example shows how to apply the \\highlight{} command within a table to make specific data stand out.\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn this chapter, we’ve explored how to enhance your R Markdown documents with figures and sophisticated table formatting using LaTeX and the creation and application of custom LaTeX commands. Starting with the tabular environment, we demonstrated the method to craft detailed tables that meet specific aesthetic and structural requirements. Additionally, we covered how to define and utilize custom LaTeX commands within your document, allowing for efficient and consistent formatting across your scientific documents. This approach ensures that your work not only conveys information effectively but also adheres to the high standards of professional and academic presentation.\n\n\n\nCrafting Complex Scientific Equations with LaTeX in R Markdown\nThe seamless integration of LaTeX within R Markdown particularly shines when dealing with complex scientific equations, which are cumbersome, if not impossible, to accurately represent in plain text or basic Markdown. LaTeX provides a comprehensive set of tools for typesetting mathematical expressions, from simple fractions to elaborate equations used in advanced physics and mathematics. This chapter demonstrates how to leverage LaTeX for this purpose within an R Markdown document.\n\nBasic Mathematical Expressions\nLaTeX allows for the inline and block display of mathematical expressions. For inline equations, enclose your LaTeX code in single dollar signs ($), and for equations that should be displayed as a separate block, use double dollar signs ($$).\nInline Equation:\nEinstein's famous equation can be represented inline as $E=mc^2$.\nDisplayed Equation:\n$$E=mc^2$$\nThis displays the equation centered on its own line, making it stand out for emphasis.\n\n\nAdvanced Equation Formatting\nLaTeX excels in formatting complex equations, such as systems of equations, matrices, and functions involving sums, integrals, and limits.\nSystem of Equations:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 10 \\\\\n2x - y &= 4\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nMatrix:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIntegral:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty e^{-x}dx\n$$\nThese examples demonstrate just a fraction of the capabilities LaTeX offers for mathematical typesetting. When utilized within R Markdown, it enables authors to seamlessly integrate complex mathematical content into their documents, enhancing both readability and professionalism.\n\n\nUtilizing LaTeX for Scientific Notation\nScientific documents often require notation that is difficult or awkward to express in other formats. LaTeX addresses this with a broad array of symbols and structures designed specifically for scientific writing:\n$$\n\\gamma + \\pi \\approx 3.14 \\text{, where } \\gamma \\text{ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and } \\pi \\text{ is the mathematical constant pi.}\n$$\nThe combination of R Markdown and LaTeX provides a powerful toolset for scientists, mathematicians, and anyone else working with complex equations or scientific notation. It brings together the best of both worlds: the dynamism and reproducibility of R Markdown with the precise typesetting and extensive capabilities of LaTeX.\n\n\nSome more complex equations\nFourier Series:\n$$\nf(x) = a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( a_n \\cos \\frac{2\\pi nx}{P} + b_n \\sin \\frac{2\\pi nx}{P} \\right)\n$$\nSchrodinger equation:\n$$\ni\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\left[ \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n$$\nGeneral relativity field equation:\n$$\nG_{\\mu\\nu} + \\Lambda g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}\n$$\nNavier-Stokes Equations for Fluid Dynamics:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{v} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{f}\n$$\nAnd render of all equations included in chapter.\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\nCompiling Documents and Customizing Outputs in R Markdown\nR Markdown provides a seamless workflow for creating dynamic documents, reports, presentations, and more, directly from R. When incorporating LaTeX, you gain additional control over the document’s appearance, enabling the creation of professional-grade scientific documents. This chapter explores how to compile your R Markdown documents into PDFs, leveraging LaTeX for advanced formatting, and how to customize these outputs to fit various academic and professional standards.\n\nCompiling R Markdown Documents to PDF\nTo compile an R Markdown document to PDF with LaTeX formatting:\n\nEnsure LaTeX is Installed: Before compiling, make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed on your computer, as discussed in the setup chapter.\nUse the ‘Knit’ Button: In RStudio, the simplest way to compile your document is by using the Knit button. When you click Knit, RStudio automatically renders your document into a PDF, incorporating any LaTeX code or styling you’ve included.\nCustomizing the Build Process: For more control over the compilation process, you can use the rmarkdown::render() function in the R console:\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"your_document.Rmd\", output_format = \"pdf_document\")\nThis function allows for additional arguments and customization, offering more flexibility than the Knit button.\n\n\nCustomizing PDF Output with LaTeX\nLaTeX allows for extensive customization of PDF output through the use of packages and settings defined in the preamble of your R Markdown document. Here are a few ways to customize your PDF documents:\n\nPage Layout and Fonts: Use LaTeX packages such as geometry to adjust margins, fancyhdr for custom headers and footers, and fontspec for font customization.\n\nheader-includes:\n  - \\usepackage{geometry}\n  - \\geometry{left=3cm,right=3cm,top=2cm,bottom=2cm}\n  - \\usepackage{fancyhdr}\n  - \\pagestyle{fancy}\n  - \\usepackage{fontspec}\n  - \\setmainfont{Times New Roman}\n\nSection Formatting: Customize section titles using the titlesec package.\n\nheader-includes:\n  - \\usepackage{titlesec}\n  - \\titleformat*{\\section}{\\Large\\bfseries}\n\nIncluding External LaTeX Files: For complex documents, you might want to maintain your LaTeX preamble in a separate .tex file and include it in your R Markdown document.\n\nheader-includes:\n  - \\input{preamble.tex}\n\n\nAdvanced Document Features\nLeveraging LaTeX within R Markdown also allows for the inclusion of advanced document features that are typically challenging to implement, such as conditional text rendering, custom automatic numbering for figures and tables, and intricate mathematical typesetting, which we’ve covered in the previous chapter.\nThe combination of R Markdown and LaTeX offers unparalleled flexibility and power for scientific document creation. By mastering the compilation process and customizing the output, you can produce documents that not only meet the rigorous standards of academic and professional communication but also reflect your personal style and preferences.\n\n\n\nFurther Resources for Mastering LaTeX in R Markdown\nHaving explored the fundamentals and some advanced techniques for integrating LaTeX into R Markdown documents, it’s beneficial to know where to look for further information, tutorials, and community support to continue enhancing your skills.

    "text": "The Journey to OOP in R\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn the world of programming, embarking on the path of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is akin to boarding a high-speed train towards more structured, efficient, and maintainable code. As we continue our series, our next stop is the “Object-Oriented Express,” where we delve into the transformative power of OOP in the R programming language. This journey isn’t just about adopting a new syntax; it’s about embracing a new mindset that revolves around objects and classes, a stark contrast to the procedural paths we’ve treaded so far.\nThe protagonist of our story, the data_quality_report() function, has served us well in its procedural form. However, as the complexity of our data analysis tasks grows, so does the need for a more scalable and maintainable structure. By refactoring this function into an R6 class, we will not only improve its organization but also enhance its functionality and extendibility. This transition to OOP will illustrate how your R code can evolve from a linear script to an elegant symphony of interacting objects and methods, each playing a specific role in the data analysis orchestra.\n\n\nRefactoring with R6 Classes\nOur journey into OOP begins with the foundational step of refactoring our existing data_quality_report() function into an R6 class. R6 classes in R represent a more advanced and versatile system for OOP, offering both the power of encapsulation and the flexibility of reference semantics.\n\nDefining the R6 Class\nWe start by defining the structure of our new class. This class will encapsulate all functionalities of our original function, transforming them into methods — functions that belong to and operate on the class itself.\nlibrary(R6)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nset.seed(123) # Ensuring reproducibility\ndummy_data &lt;- tibble(\n  id = 1:1000,\n  category = sample(c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", NA), 1000, replace = TRUE),\n  value = c(rnorm(997), -10, 100, NA), # Including outliers and a missing value\n  date = seq.Date(from = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"), by = \"day\", length.out = 1000),\n  text = sample(c(\"Lorem\", \"Ipsum\", \"Dolor\", \"Sit\", NA), 1000, replace = TRUE)\n)\n\nDataQualityReport &lt;- R6Class(\n  \"DataQualityReport\",\n  public = list(\n    data = NULL,\n    \n    initialize = function(data) {\n      if (!is.data.frame(data)) {\n        stop(\"Data must be a dataframe.\")\n      }\n      self$data &lt;- data\n    },\n    \n    calculate_missing_values = function() {\n      return(\n        self$data %&gt;%\n          summarize(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.)))) %&gt;%\n          pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"column\", values_to = \"missing_values\")\n      )\n    },\n    \n    detect_outliers = function() {\n      return(\n        self$data %&gt;%\n          select(where(is.numeric)) %&gt;%\n          imap(~{\n            qnt &lt;- quantile(.x, probs = c(0.25, 0.75), na.rm = TRUE)\n            iqr &lt;- IQR(.x, na.rm = TRUE)\n            lower_bound &lt;- qnt[1] - 1.5 * iqr\n            upper_bound &lt;- qnt[2] + 1.5 * iqr\n            outlier_count &lt;- sum(.x &lt; lower_bound | .x &gt; upper_bound, na.rm = TRUE)\n            tibble(column = .y, lower_bound, upper_bound, outlier_count)\n          }) %&gt;%\n          bind_rows()\n      )\n    },\n    \n    summarize_data_types = function() {\n      return(\n        self$data %&gt;%\n          summarize(across(everything(), ~paste(class(.), collapse = \", \"))) %&gt;%\n          pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"column\", values_to = \"data_type\")\n      )\n    },\n    \n    generate_report = function() {\n      return(\n        list(\n          MissingValues = self$calculate_missing_values(),\n          Outliers = self$detect_outliers(),\n          DataTypes = self$summarize_data_types()\n        )\n      )\n    }\n  )\n)\n\n# Example of creating an instance and using the class\ndata_report_instance &lt;- DataQualityReport$new(dummy_data)\nreport &lt;- data_report_instance$generate_report()\n\nprint(report)\n\n$MissingValues\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  column   missing_values\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;int&gt;\n1 id                    0\n2 category            246\n3 value                 1\n4 date                  0\n5 text                180\n\n$Outliers\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  column lower_bound upper_bound outlier_count\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 id         -498.       1500.               0\n2 value        -2.71        2.67             9\n\n$DataTypes\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  column   data_type\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 id       integer  \n2 category character\n3 value    numeric  \n4 date     Date     \n5 text     character\nIn this refactoring, each key task of the original function becomes a method within our R6 class. The initialize method sets up the object with the necessary data. The calculate_missing_values, detect_outliers, and summarize_data_types methods each handle a specific aspect of the data quality report, encapsulating the functionality in a clear and organized manner. The generate_report method brings these pieces together to produce the final report.\n\n\n\nThe Power of Modular Design\nThe transition to an R6 class structure is not just a change in syntax; it’s a shift towards a more modular design. Modular programming is a design technique that breaks a program into separate, interchangeable modules, each handling a specific subtask. This approach has several benefits:\n\nImproved Readability: When functions are broken down into smaller, purpose-specific methods, it becomes easier to understand what each part of the code does. This clarity is invaluable, especially as the complexity of the codebase grows.\nEnhanced Maintainability: With a modular structure, updating the code becomes more straightforward. If a specific aspect of the functionality needs to be changed, you only need to modify the relevant method, rather than wading through a monolithic function.\nEasier Debugging and Testing: Each module or method can be tested independently, simplifying the debugging process. This independent testability ensures that changes in one part of the code do not inadvertently affect other parts.\nReusability: Modular design promotes the reuse of code. Methods in an R6 class can be reused across different projects or datasets, facilitating a more efficient and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) coding practice.\n\nIn our DataQualityReport class, the modular design is evident. The class acts as a container for related methods, each responsible for a different aspect of data quality reporting. This organization makes it clear what each part of the code is doing, and allows for easy modifications and extensions in the future.\n\n\nExtending Functionality\nA key advantage of OOP and our R6 class structure is the ease of extending functionality. For example, we can add a new method to our DataQualityReport class that exports the generated report to a CSV file. This extension demonstrates how we can build upon our existing class without altering its core functionality:\nDataQualityReport$set(\"public\", \"export_to_csv\", function(file_name) {\n  report &lt;- self$generate_report()\n  write.csv(report$MissingValues, paste0(file_name, \"_missing_values.csv\"))\n  write.csv(report$Outliers, paste0(file_name, \"_outliers.csv\"))\n  write.csv(report$DataTypes, paste0(file_name, \"_data_types.csv\"))\n  message(\"Report exported to CSV files with base name: \", file_name)\n})\n\ndata_report_instance2 &lt;- DataQualityReport$new(dummy_data)\n\ndata_report_instance2$export_to_csv(\"data_report\")\n\n#&gt; Report exported to CSV files with base name: data_report\nWith this new export_to_csv method, our class not only analyzes the data but also provides an easy way to export the results, enhancing the user experience and the utility of our class.\n\n\nOOP in R — A Paradigm Shift\nThe journey of refactoring our data_quality_report() function into an R6 class represents more than just an exercise in coding. It signifies a paradigm shift in the way we think about and structure our R code. By embracing OOP, we’re not only streamlining our workflow but also opening doors to more advanced programming practices that can handle larger, more complex tasks with ease.\nThe modular design, enhanced maintainability, and extensibility we’ve achieved with our DataQualityReport class illustrate the profound impact OOP can have. This shift in approach, from procedural to object-oriented, is a crucial step towards writing more robust, scalable, and efficient R code.\nAs we continue our exploration in R programming, I encourage readers to experiment with OOP. Embrace its principles in your projects and discover how it can transform your code, making it not only more powerful but also a joy to work with."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The purrr package is a vital player in the tidyverse, an ecosystem of R packages designed to streamline data analysis tasks. As the Swiss Army knife of functional programming in R, purrr provides a versatile toolkit for working with data structures, especially lists and data frames. By simplifying complex operations, it brings clarity and elegance to your code, enabling you to manipulate, transform, and summarize data with ease. Picture purrr as the conductor of an orchestra, harmonizing the different sections of the tidyverse to create a beautiful symphony of data analysis. In this article, we’ll delve into the intricacies of purrr and discover how it can help you harness the full potential of R in your data analysis journey.\n\nUnderstanding purrr: The Functional Programming Paradigm\nTo fully appreciate the purrr package, it’s essential to understand the functional programming paradigm, which serves as the foundation of purrr’s capabilities.\nFunctional programming is a programming approach that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions while avoiding changing state and mutable data. This style of programming emphasizes the use of pure functions, which are functions that, given the same input, will always produce the same output without any side effects. Picture functional programming like a composer, who brings together various instruments, playing their individual parts in perfect harmony, to create a unified and elegant piece of music.\nFunctional programming offers several benefits when working with R, particularly for data analysis. Some of these advantages include:\n\nReadability: Functional programming promotes writing clean and modular code, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and maintain the code. Think of it as a well-organized musical score, with each section clearly marked and easy to follow.\nReusability: Pure functions can be easily reused across different parts of your code, as they don’t rely on any external state. This reduces the need to write repetitive code and allows you to create a library of versatile functions, much like a conductor reusing musical motifs throughout a symphony.\nEase of debugging: By minimizing the use of mutable data and global state, functional programming reduces the likelihood of unexpected bugs, making the code more predictable and easier to debug. It’s akin to a conductor being able to isolate and resolve any discordant notes within the orchestra.\nParallel processing: The absence of side effects in functional programming allows for more efficient parallel processing, enabling you to harness the full power of modern multi-core processors. It’s like having multiple conductors working in perfect sync, seamlessly leading the orchestra in harmony.\n\nThe purrr package is designed to work seamlessly with R’s functional programming capabilities. One of its key strengths lies in its ability to apply functions to elements within data structures, such as lists and data frames. The package offers a range of “map” functions that allow you to elegantly iterate over these structures, transforming and manipulating the data as needed. This powerful feature of purrr serves as the conductor’s baton, guiding the flow of your data analysis and helping you create a harmonious and efficient workflow.\nIn the following sections, we will explore purrr’s key functions and demonstrate how they can help you streamline your data analysis process in R.\n\n\nA Closer Look at purrr’s Key Functions\nNow that we have a solid understanding of the functional programming paradigm, let’s dive into some of the key functions that the purrr package offers. These functions, like a conductor’s hand gestures, guide the flow of data through various operations, ensuring an efficient and harmonious analysis.\nmap() and its variants: Turning a caterpillar of code into a butterfly\nThe map() function is the cornerstone of the purrr package, allowing you to apply a function to each element of a list or vector. This versatile function can simplify your code by replacing cumbersome for loops and lapply() calls with a more concise and expressive syntax. The map() function comes in several variants, each tailored to return a specific type of output, such as map_lgl() for logical, map_chr() for character, and map_dbl() for double values. This flexibility enables you to transform your code into a more elegant and streamlined form, much like a caterpillar metamorphosing into a beautiful butterfly.\npmap(): Mastering multiple inputs like juggling balls\nThe pmap() function is designed to handle multiple input lists or vectors, iterating over them in parallel and applying a specified function. This powerful function allows you to juggle multiple inputs effortlessly, enabling complex data manipulation and transformation with ease. Like a skilled juggler, pmap() keeps all the input “balls” in the air, ensuring that they’re processed and combined as intended.\nkeep() and discard(): Handpicking data like sorting apples\nWhen you need to filter data based on specific criteria, purrr’s keep() and discard() functions come to the rescue. keep() retains elements that meet a given condition, while discard() removes elements that meet the condition. These functions let you handpick data elements as if you were sorting apples, keeping the good ones and discarding the bad. With their intuitive syntax and functional programming approach, keep() and discard() make data filtering a breeze.\nreduce(): Folding data like origami\nThe reduce() function in purrr allows you to successively apply a function to elements of a list or vector, effectively “folding” the data like an intricate piece of origami. This function is particularly useful when you need to aggregate data or combine elements in a specific manner. By iteratively applying a specified function, reduce() skillfully folds your data into the desired shape or form.\nsafely(): Handling errors gracefully like a trapeze artist\nIn data analysis, errors and unexpected situations can arise. The safely() function in purrr enables you to handle these scenarios with grace and poise, much like a trapeze artist performing a complex routine. safely() takes a function as input and returns a new function that, when applied, captures any errors and returns them as part of the output, rather than halting the execution. This allows you to identify and address errors without disrupting the flow of your analysis.\nThese key functions, along with many others in the purrr package, provide a powerful toolkit for efficient and harmonious data analysis in R. In the next sections, we’ll explore how to apply these functions to real-life data analysis tasks and demonstrate their practical applications.\n\n\nApplying purrr to Real-Life Data Analysis Tasks\nNow that we’ve explored the key functions of the purrr package, let’s examine how they can be applied to real-life data analysis tasks. By integrating purrr into your workflow, you can master the art of data analysis like a skilled conductor, guiding the flow of data through various operations and producing harmonious results.\nData transformation: Cleaning up a messy room\nData transformation is an essential step in the data analysis process, as real-world data can often be messy and unstructured. Using purrr’s map() functions, you can easily apply cleaning and transformation operations to your data, much like tidying up a cluttered room. For example, you might use map_chr() to extract specific information from text strings, or map_dbl() to convert data types within a data frame. By applying these functions iteratively, you can transform and reshape your data into a more structured and usable format.\nData aggregation: Assembling a puzzle\nIn many cases, you’ll need to aggregate data from multiple sources or perform complex calculations to derive insights. The reduce() function in purrr allows you to combine data elements like puzzle pieces, iteratively applying a function to merge or aggregate data as needed. Whether you’re summing up values, calculating averages, or performing custom aggregations, reduce() can help you assemble the data puzzle and reveal the bigger picture.\nData summarization: Condensing a novel into a short story\nData summarization is the process of distilling large amounts of information into concise, meaningful insights. Using purrr’s functional programming approach, you can create custom summary functions that extract relevant information from your data, much like condensing a novel into a short story. By chaining together map() functions with other tidyverse tools, such as dplyr’s summarize() and mutate() functions, you can generate insightful summaries that highlight the most important aspects of your data.\nIterative operations: Unraveling the threads of data\nMany data analysis tasks require performing iterative operations, such as running simulations, fitting models, or processing data in chunks. With purrr’s pmap() function, you can effortlessly juggle multiple inputs and apply functions across them in parallel. This enables you to unravel the threads of data, revealing patterns and relationships that might otherwise remain hidden. Additionally, by combining purrr’s functions with other R tools, such as parallel processing packages or machine learning libraries, you can further enhance the efficiency and power of your iterative operations.\nIn summary, purrr’s functional programming capabilities enable you to tackle a wide range of data analysis tasks with elegance and efficiency. By integrating purrr into your workflow, you can master the art of data analysis, conducting your data orchestra in perfect harmony.\n\n\nCase Study: Building Models and Creating Visualizations with purrr and Nested Data\nIn R we usually have many function vectorized which mean that for example they can be used on column of dataframe without using loop, apply or map. Purrr’s map functions can of course be used to apply vectorized functions, but is too easy. Let me show you something little bit harder and showing more of purrr’s capabilities.\nIn this case study, we will demonstrate how to use purrr with nested data to build multiple models and create custom visualizations.\nIntroducing the dataset: A collection of diverse species\nImagine we have a dataset containing measurements of various iris species, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, as well as the species classification. Our goal is to create separate linear regression models for each species to predict petal length based on petal width and visualize the results.\nData preparation: Nesting the data like a matryoshka doll\nTo begin, we need to split the dataset by species and create a nested data frame. We can use dplyr’s group_by() and tidyr’s nest() functions for this task:"

    "text": "Embracing the Tidyverse Style Guide\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nIn the vast and ever-expanding universe of data, the ability to not just see but truly understand the stories hidden within numbers becomes paramount. This journey of comprehension isn’t unlike the iconic moment from The Matrix, where Neo, standing amidst the endless possibilities of the digital realm, declares his need for “Guns, lots of guns.” In the context of our exploration, these “guns” are not weapons of destruction but powerful tools of creation and insight — data visualization packages for R, each with its unique capabilities to transform raw data into compelling narratives.\nOur quest is navigated through the versatile landscapes of Quarto and R Markdown (Rmd), platforms that serve as the backbone for our reports. Whether you’re drafting an interactive web document, a static PDF, or a neatly formatted Word file, these tools are the canvases upon which our data stories will unfold. But a canvas alone does not make art — it’s the brushes, colors, and techniques that bring a scene to life. Similarly, our chosen R packages — each a brushstroke of genius — allow us to paint intricate pictures with our data.\nThis article will serve as your guide through this arsenal of visualization packages. From the foundational ggplot2 to the interactive plotly, the geospatial leaflet, and the detailed gt for tabular artistry, we’ll cover a spectrum of tools that cater to every analyst’s, researcher’s, and data storyteller’s needs. We’ll delve into how each package can be utilized within Quarto and R Markdown to create reports that not only convey information but also engage and enlighten your audience.\nAs we embark on this journey together, remember that the power of these tools lies not just in their individual capabilities but in how they can be combined to tell a cohesive, compelling story. By the end of this exploration, you’ll be equipped with a diverse and potent arsenal, ready to tackle any data visualization challenge that comes your way.\nLet the journey begin.\n\n\nThe Foundation with ggplot2\nAt the heart of our data visualization arsenal lies ggplot2, a package that has revolutionized the way we think about and create graphics in R. Inspired by Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics, ggplot2 allows users to assemble plots layer by layer, making the creation of complex visualizations both intuitive and accessible.\nggplot2 shines in its ability to break down and understand data visualization as a series of logical steps: data selection, aesthetic mapping, geometric objects, and statistical transformations. This structured approach enables users to craft nearly any type of graphic, from simple scatter plots to intricate layered visualizations. The package’s extensive customization options—through scales, themes, and coordinates—further empower users to tailor their visuals to the precise narrative they wish to convey.\nFor reports in Quarto or R Markdown, ggplot2 acts as the foundational tool for data visualization. Its versatility is unmatched, offering crisp, publication-quality graphics for static outputs (PDF, DOCX) and adaptable visuals for dynamic HTML documents. Whether you’re creating a formal report, a comprehensive academic paper, or an engaging web article, ggplot2 provides the necessary tools to visually articulate your data’s story.\nTo illustrate the power of ggplot2, let’s create a simple yet elegant scatter plot:\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Sample data\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  x = rnorm(100),\n  y = rnorm(100)\n)\n\n# Scatter plot\nggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_point(color = 'blue') +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\"Sample Scatter Plot\") +\n  xlab(\"X-axis Label\") +\n  ylab(\"Y-axis Label\")\n\n\n\nSample Scatter Plot\n\n\nThis code snippet highlights ggplot2’s simplicity and elegance, creating a plot that is both visually appealing and informative. As we proceed to explore more specialized packages, ggplot2 remains our trusted foundation, enabling us to build upon it and enhance our reports with diverse visual narratives.\n\n\nEnhancing Interactivity with plotly\nIn the dynamic world of web-based reporting, plotly stands out as a beacon of interactivity. It builds upon the static beauty of ggplot2 plots by adding a layer of engagement through interactive elements. Users can hover over data points, zoom in on areas of interest, and filter through datasets directly within their plots, transforming a static visualization into an interactive exploration.\nplotly offers a wide range of interactive chart types, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and more, all with the added benefit of user interaction. It’s particularly adept at handling large datasets, making it possible to explore and interpret complex data in real-time. The package’s ability to integrate with ggplot2 means that users can easily elevate their existing visualizations from static to dynamic with minimal effort.\nFor HTML reports created in Quarto or R Markdown, plotly enhances the reader’s experience by making the data exploration an integral part of the narrative. This level of interactivity invites the audience to engage with the data on a deeper level, facilitating a more personalized exploration of the findings. It’s especially useful in scenarios where understanding data nuances is crucial, such as in exploratory data analysis or when presenting results to a diverse audience.\nHere’s how to transform a ggplot2 plot into an interactive plotly plot:\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Create a ggplot\np &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +\n  geom_point(aes(text = rownames(mtcars)), size = 4) +\n  labs(title = \"Motor Trend Car Road Tests\",\n       x = \"Weight (1000 lbs)\",\n       y = \"Miles/(US) gallon\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Convert to plotly\nggplotly(p, tooltip = \"text\")\nThis code demonstrates the ease with which a static ggplot2 visualization can be converted into an interactive plotly graph. By incorporating plotly into your data storytelling toolkit, you unlock a world where data visualizations are not just seen but experienced.\n\n\nMapping Data with leaflet\nGeospatial data visualization is a critical aspect of storytelling in many fields, from environmental science to urban planning. leaflet for R brings the power of interactive mapping to your reports, allowing you to create detailed, dynamic maps that can be embedded directly into HTML documents. Based on the Leaflet.js library, it is the premier tool for building interactive maps in the R ecosystem.\nWith leaflet, you can layer multiple data sources on a single map, customize map appearances, and add interactive features like pop-ups and markers. It supports various map types, including base maps from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Google Maps. Whether you’re tracking migration patterns, visualizing climate change data, or showcasing demographic trends, leaflet makes geospatial data accessible and engaging.\nFor Quarto or R Markdown reports destined for the web, leaflet maps offer a dynamic way to present geospatial data. Unlike static maps, leaflet enables readers to zoom in and out, explore different layers, and interact with the data points directly. This interactivity enhances the user’s engagement and understanding, making leaflet an invaluable tool for reports that include location-based analysis or findings.\nCreating an interactive map with leaflet is straightforward:\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n# Sample data: Locations of some major cities\ncities &lt;- data.frame(\n  lon = c(-74.00597, -0.127758, 151.20732),\n  lat = c(40.71278, 51.50735, -33.86785),\n  city = c(\"New York\", \"London\", \"Sydney\")\n)\n\n# Create a leaflet map\nleaflet(cities) %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\n  addMarkers(~lon, ~lat, popup = ~city)\n\n\n\nInteractive Map\n\n\nThis example demonstrates how to create a basic interactive map showing specific locations. With leaflet, the complexity and depth of your geospatial visualizations are limited only by your imagination.\n\n\nInteractive Tables with DT\nIn the realm of data presentation, tables are indispensable for displaying detailed information in a structured manner. DT (DataTables) is an R package that integrates the jQuery DataTables plugin, transforming static tables into interactive exploration tools. It enables users to search, sort, and paginate tables directly within HTML reports, enhancing the user’s ability to engage with and understand the data.\nDT offers a plethora of features to make tables more interactive and user-friendly. Highlights include automatic or custom column filtering, options for table styling, and the ability to include buttons for exporting the table to CSV, Excel, or PDF formats. These functionalities are particularly useful in reports that contain large datasets, allowing readers to navigate and focus on the data that interests them most.\nFor reports generated in Quarto or R Markdown with an HTML output, DT provides a superior way to present tabular data. It bridges the gap between static tables, which can be overwhelming and difficult to navigate, and the need for dynamic, accessible data presentation. Whether you’re summarizing survey results, financial data, or scientific measurements, DT tables can significantly improve the readability and usability of your reports.\nHere’s a simple example of how to create an interactive table with DT:\nlibrary(DT)\n\n# Sample data: A subset of the mtcars dataset\ndata(mtcars)\nmtcars_subset &lt;- head(mtcars, 10)\n\n# Render an interactive table\ndatatable(mtcars_subset, options = list(pageLength = 5, autoWidth = TRUE))\n\n\n\nInteractive Table\n\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to convert a subset of the mtcars dataset into an interactive table, complete with pagination and adjustable column widths. By integrating DT into your reporting toolkit, you can ensure that even the densest data tables become navigable and insightful components of your narrative.\n\n\nThe Grammar of Tables with gt\nWhile DT focuses on interactivity for data tables, the gt package brings unparalleled levels of customization and styling to table creation in R. Standing for “Grammar of Tables,” gt allows you to create highly detailed and beautifully formatted tables that communicate information clearly and effectively, akin to how ggplot2 revolutionizes plot creation.\ngt enables you to craft tables that go beyond mere data presentation; it allows you to tell a story with your data. From adding footnotes, coloring cells based on values, to creating complex layouts with grouped headers and spanning labels, gt provides a comprehensive suite of tools for enhancing the aesthetic and functional aspects of tables in your reports.\nIn Quarto or R Markdown reports, regardless of the output format (HTML, PDF, or DOCX), gt tables can significantly elevate the visual standard and readability of your presentations. Especially in PDFs and printed documents, where interactive elements are not feasible, the detailed customization gt offers makes your tables not just data containers but key narrative elements of your report.\nTo demonstrate the capabilities of gt, let’s create a simple yet styled table using a subset of the mtcars dataset:\nlibrary(gt)\n\n# Sample data: A subset of the mtcars dataset\ndata &lt;- head(mtcars, 10)\n\ngt_table &lt;- gt(data) %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Motor Trend Car Road Tests\",\n    subtitle = \"A subset of the mtcars dataset\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  cols_label(\n    mpg = \"Miles/(US) gallon\",\n    cyl = \"Number of Cylinders\",\n    disp = \"Displacement (cu.in.)\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = vars(mpg, disp),\n    decimals = 2\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_fill(color = \"gray\"),\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"white\"),\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = TRUE)\n  )\n\ngt_table\n\n\n\nStyled Table\n\n\nThis code snippet highlights how gt not only allows for the structuring and presentation of tabular data but also for the artistic expression within data reporting, making your tables both informative and visually appealing.\n\n\nBringing Plots to Life with ggiraph\nIn the quest to make reports more engaging, ggiraph emerges as a powerful ally, enabling the transformation of static ggplot2 graphics into interactive visual stories. ggiraph allows elements within ggplot2 plots, such as points, lines, and bars, to become interactive, supporting tooltips, hover actions, and even hyperlinks. This interactivity enriches the user experience, allowing for a deeper exploration and understanding of the underlying data.\nThe ggiraph package shines when you want to add a layer of engagement to your data visualizations. With it, viewers can hover over specific elements to see more details or click on parts of the graph to access external resources. This capability is invaluable for online reports, where reader engagement and interactivity are paramount.\nFor HTML-based reports created with Quarto or R Markdown, ggiraph enhances the storytelling potential by making data visualizations a two-way interaction channel. This feature is especially useful for exploratory data analysis, educational materials, or any report aiming to provide an immersive data exploration experience. While ggiraph excels in web environments, the static versions of these enriched plots still retain their aesthetic and informational value in PDF or DOCX outputs.\nHere’s a basic example of how to create an interactive plot with ggiraph, making use of a simple ggplot2 bar chart:\n# Example taken from https://www.productive-r-workflow.com/quarto-tricks#ggiraph\n# It was too good not to share it with you.\n# You can find more Quatro tricks on this site. \n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggiraph)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# Example data - replace with your data\nmap_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = 1:3,\n  lat = c(40, 42, 37),\n  lon = c(-100, -120, -95),\n  group = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\")\n)\n\nline_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = rep(1:3, each = 10),\n  time = rep(seq(as.Date(\"2021-01-01\"), by = \"1 month\", length.out = 10), 3),\n  value = rnorm(30),\n  group = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"), each = 10)\n)\n\n# Map with interactive points\nmap_plot &lt;- ggplot() +\n  borders(\"world\", colour = \"gray80\", fill = \"gray90\") +  # Add a world map background\n  geom_point_interactive(data = map_data, aes(x = lon, y = lat, size = 5, color=group, tooltip = group, data_id = group)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-130, -65), ylim = c(10, 75)) \n\n\n# Line chart with interactive lines\nline_plot &lt;- ggplot(line_data, aes(x = time, y = value, group = group, color=group)) +\n  geom_line_interactive(aes(data_id = group, tooltip = group))\n\ncombined_plot &lt;- girafe(\n  ggobj = map_plot + plot_spacer() + line_plot + plot_layout(widths = c(0.35, 0, 0.65)),\n  options = list(\n    opts_hover(css = ''),\n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.1;\"), \n    opts_sizing(rescale = FALSE)\n  ),\n  height_svg = 4,\n  width_svg = 12\n)\n\n\n\nInteractive Plot\n\n\nThis example assumes a scenario where clicking on a point on the map would dynamically highlight the corresponding line on the line chart on the left. As you see, the alpha of lines for categories that are not pointed decreases to emphasize the clicked one.\n\n\nSeamless Plot Compositions with patchwork\nWhile ggiraph brings individual plots to life with interactivity, patchwork is the tool for harmoniously combining multiple ggplot2 plots into a cohesive composition. patchwork simplifies the process of arranging multiple plots, allowing for complex layouts that maintain a unified aesthetic. It’s akin to assembling a visual symphony from individual notes, where each plot plays its part in the overarching data narrative.\npatchwork excels in its flexibility and ease of use, offering a syntax that is both intuitive and powerful. It allows for the vertical, horizontal, and nested arrangement of plots, and gives you control over spacing, alignment, and even shared legends. This capability is invaluable when you need to compare different aspects of your data side by side or tell a multi-faceted story through a series of visualizations.\nIn both Quarto and R Markdown reports, regardless of the output format, patchwork enables you to create visually appealing and informative plot arrangements. For static reports (PDF, DOCX), these compositions can help convey complex information in a digestible format. For HTML reports, while patchwork does not add interactivity to the plots themselves, the strategic arrangement of visual elements can guide the reader’s exploration of the data.\nTo demonstrate the power of patchwork, let’s create a composition of two simple ggplot2 plots:\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# First plot: A scatter plot\np1 &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp)) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = cyl)) + \n  labs(title = \"Displacement vs. MPG\")\n\n# Second plot: A bar plot\np2 &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl))) + \n  geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(cyl))) + \n  labs(title = \"Cylinder Count\")\n\n# Combine the plots with patchwork\nplot_combo &lt;- p1 + p2 + \n  plot_layout(ncol = 1, heights = c(1, 1)) +\n  plot_annotation(title = \"Vehicle Characteristics\")\n\n# Display the combined plot\nplot_combo\n\n\n\nCombined Plot\n\n\nThis example illustrates how patchwork seamlessly combines two distinct ggplot2 plots into a single, coherent visual statement. By arranging plots in a thoughtfully designed layout, you can enhance the storytelling impact of your data visualizations in reports.\n\n\nMastering Your Data Visualization Arsenal\nOur journey through the landscape of R packages for enhancing reports in Quarto and R Markdown mirrors the pivotal scene from The Matrix, where an array of tools is summoned with a clear mission in mind. In our narrative, these tools — ggplot2, plotly, leaflet, DT, gt, ggiraph, and patchwork—form a robust arsenal, each offering unique capabilities to make our data reports not just informative, but compelling and engaging.\n\nggplot2 laid the foundation, offering a versatile platform for creating a wide range of plots with deep customization options, ensuring that every chart precisely conveys its intended message.\nplotly and ggiraph introduced interactivity, transforming static images into dynamic conversations, inviting readers to explore and interact with the data on their terms.\nleaflet allowed us to map our narratives, providing geographical context and making location data more accessible and understandable.\nDT and gt revolutionized how we present tabular data, turning dense tables into clear, engaging visual elements of our reports.\npatchwork taught us the art of composition, enabling us to weave individual plots into coherent visual stories that guide the reader through our analyses seamlessly.\n\nEach of these packages can be seen as a different type of “firearm” in our data visualization arsenal, equipped to tackle specific challenges and objectives in the realm of digital reporting. Whether we’re aiming for clarity, engagement, interactivity, or all of the above, our toolkit is now fully stocked to bring any data story to life.\nAs we conclude this exploration, remember that the true power of these tools lies not just in their individual capabilities but in how they can be combined to tell a cohesive, compelling story. Just as Neo chose his arsenal for the mission ahead, you now have the knowledge to select the right tools for your data visualization needs, ensuring your reports are not only seen but remembered.\nThe landscape of data storytelling is vast and ever-changing, but with this arsenal at your disposal, you’re well-equipped to make your mark. So, take these tools, explore their potential, and start crafting data stories that resonate, inform, and inspire."

    "text": "Shiny and Beyond\n\n\n\n\nIn today’s data-driven world, the ability to create dynamic, interactive web applications is a highly valuable skill. Shiny, a package developed by RStudio, provides an elegant framework for building such applications using R. It enables data scientists and analysts to transform their analyses into interactive experiences, making data insights accessible and engaging. This article series will guide you through mastering Shiny, starting with the basics and gradually introducing more advanced concepts and tools, including powerful packages from Appsilon that enhance Shiny’s capabilities.\n\n\n\nShiny allows you to turn your R scripts into interactive web applications effortlessly. Whether you’re looking to create simple data visualizations or complex, multi-page applications, Shiny offers the flexibility and power needed to meet your objectives. Some key benefits include:\n\nEase of Use: Shiny’s syntax is intuitive, and if you are familiar with R, you can quickly start building applications.\nInteractive Data Exploration: Users can interact with data visualizations, filtering and modifying parameters in real-time to uncover insights.\nRapid Prototyping: Shiny allows for quick development and iteration, making it perfect for prototyping data products.\nIntegration with R: Leverage the full power of R, including its extensive library of packages for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into creating your first Shiny application, ensure you have R and RStudio installed. Additionally, you’ll need to install the Shiny package if you haven’t already. Here’s how to set up your environment:\ninstall.packages(\"shiny\", repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")\n\n\n\nA Shiny application consists of two main components:\n\nUI (User Interface): Defines the layout and appearance of your app.\nServer: Contains the logic that runs behind the scenes, processing inputs and generating outputs.\n\nLet’s create a simple Shiny app to demonstrate these components. The following code defines a basic app that allows users to interact with a dataset and visualize its contents.\n\n\n\nWe’ll create an app that displays the famous mtcars dataset. Users can select variables to plot and see the relationship between them.\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define the UI\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"Mtcars Dataset Explorer\"),\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"xvar\", \"X-axis variable\", choices = names(mtcars)),\n      selectInput(\"yvar\", \"Y-axis variable\", choices = names(mtcars), selected = \"mpg\")\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"scatterPlot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define the server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  output$scatterPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(mtcars, aes_string(x = input$xvar, y = input$yvar)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      labs(title = paste(\"Scatter plot of\", input$xvar, \"vs\", input$yvar))\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nMtcars Scatter Plot\n\n\nThis simple example demonstrates the basic structure of a Shiny app, showcasing how user inputs can dynamically influence the output. With this foundation, we are ready to explore more advanced features and customizations in the next chapters, including leveraging powerful Appsilon packages to enhance our Shiny applications.\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the powerful enhancements offered by Appsilon packages, it’s essential to thoroughly understand the capabilities of “vanilla” Shiny. This chapter will explore what Shiny can do out of the box, including its core features, customization options, and how it facilitates interactive data exploration. By mastering these foundational aspects, you will be well-prepared to leverage additional tools to create even more sophisticated applications.\n\n\n\nVanilla Shiny provides a robust framework for building interactive web applications directly from R. Its key features include:\n\nInteractive Widgets: Shiny offers a variety of input controls like sliders, dropdowns, text inputs, and date selectors. These widgets allow users to interact with your data and analyses dynamically.\nReactive Programming: At the heart of Shiny is its reactivity system, which ensures that the output updates automatically whenever the inputs change. This reactive model simplifies the development of interactive applications.\nDynamic User Interfaces: Shiny allows you to create UIs that change dynamically in response to user inputs. This enables the development of more interactive and responsive applications.\nSeamless Integration with R: Since Shiny is built for R, you can use any R package within your Shiny apps. This includes popular packages for data manipulation (dplyr), visualization (ggplot2), and machine learning (caret).\nExtensibility: Shiny applications can be extended with custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing for more advanced customization and functionality.\n\n\n\n\nShiny provides a rich set of input controls that you can use to create interactive applications. Here are some commonly used widgets:\n\nSlider Input: Allows users to select a range of values.\n\nsliderInput(\"obs\", \"Number of observations:\", min = 1, max = 1000, value = 500)\n\nSelect Input: Provides a dropdown menu for users to select from a list of options.\n\nselectInput(\"var\", \"Variable:\", choices = names(mtcars))\n\nText Input: Allows users to enter text.\n\ntextInput(\"caption\", \"Caption:\", \"Data Summary\")\n\nDate Input: Allows users to select a date.\n\ndateInput(\"date\", \"Date:\", value = Sys.Date())\nThese widgets can be combined to create a rich user interface for your applications.\n\n\n\nReactivity is a core concept in Shiny that makes it easy to build interactive applications. Reactive expressions and observers automatically update outputs when their inputs change.\n\nReactive Expressions: Functions that return a value and automatically re-execute when their dependencies change.\n\nreactiveExpression &lt;- reactive({\n  input$sliderValue * 2\n})\n\nObservers: Functions that perform actions rather than returning values, and automatically re-execute when their dependencies change.\n\nobserve({\n  print(input$sliderValue)\n})\nHere’s an example demonstrating reactivity:\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define the UI\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"Reactive Example\"),\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      sliderInput(\"num\", \"Number of observations:\", 1, 100, 50)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      textOutput(\"value\"),\n      plotOutput(\"histPlot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define the server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  output$value &lt;- renderText({\n    paste(\"You selected\", input$num, \"observations\")\n  })\n\n  output$histPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    hist(rnorm(input$num))\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nReactive Example\n\n\nIn this example:\n\nThe text output (output$value) and the plot output (output$histPlot) are both reactive, updating automatically when the slider input (input$num) changes.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Shiny’s built-in functions are powerful, you may sometimes need more control over the UI’s appearance and behavior. Shiny allows you to use custom HTML and CSS for further customization.\nHere’s an example of incorporating custom HTML and CSS:\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define the UI\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  tags$head(\n    tags$style(HTML(\"\n      body { background-color: #f7f7f7; }\n      h1 { color: #2c3e50; }\n      .well { background-color: #ecf0f1; }\n    \"))\n  ),\n  titlePanel(\"Custom Styled App\"),\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      sliderInput(\"num\", \"Number of observations:\", 1, 100, 50)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"histPlot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define the server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  output$histPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    hist(rnorm(input$num))\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nCustom Styled App\n\n\nIn this example:\n\nWe used tags$head and tags$style to include custom CSS directly in the Shiny app.\nThe background color, header color, and well panel color have been customized using CSS.\n\n\n\n\nFor even more advanced interactivity and functionality, you can extend Shiny applications with custom JavaScript. Shiny provides hooks for integrating JavaScript code, allowing you to add custom behavior to your apps.\nHere’s an example of adding a custom JavaScript alert when a button is clicked:\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define the UI\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"JavaScript Integration\"),\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      actionButton(\"alertButton\", \"Show Alert\")\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"histPlot\")\n    )\n  ),\n  tags$script(HTML(\"\n    $(document).on('click', '#alertButton', function() {\n      alert('Button clicked!');\n    });\n  \"))\n)\n\n# Define the server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  output$histPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    hist(rnorm(100))\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nJavaScript Integration\n\n\nIn this example:\n\nWe used tags$script to include custom JavaScript directly in the Shiny app.\nA JavaScript alert is displayed when the button is clicked.\n\nBy mastering these core features and customization options, you can create powerful and engaging Shiny applications. In the next chapter, we will explore how to enhance these applications further with Appsilon’s styling packages, adding even more capabilities and visual appeal to your Shiny projects.\n\n\n\nThe user interface (UI) is a critical aspect of any web application, as it determines how users interact with your app and how accessible and engaging it is. In Shiny, the default UI components are functional but can sometimes look plain and lack the polish needed for professional applications. This is where Appsilon’s styling packages come in. By using shiny.semantic, shiny.fluent, and semantic.dashboard, you can create visually appealing and highly interactive UIs that stand out.\n\n\n\nshiny.semantic allows you to use Semantic UI, a front-end framework that provides a wide range of theming options and UI components, within your Shiny applications. This integration helps you create modern, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces without needing extensive knowledge of HTML or CSS.\nTo start using shiny.semantic, you’ll first need to install and load the package:\ninstall.packages(\"shiny.semantic\", repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")\nlibrary(shiny.semantic)\nLet’s enhance our previous mtcars app with shiny.semantic to give it a more modern look:\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(shiny.semantic)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Define the UI with shiny.semantic\nui &lt;- semanticPage(\n  title = \"Mtcars Dataset Explorer\",\n  segment(\n    title = \"Mtcars Dataset Explorer\",\n    sidebar_layout(\n      sidebar_panel(\n        selectInput(\"xvar\", \"X-axis variable\", choices = names(mtcars)),\n        selectInput(\"yvar\", \"Y-axis variable\", choices = names(mtcars), selected = \"mpg\")\n      ),\n      main_panel(\n        plotOutput(\"scatterPlot\")\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define the server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  output$scatterPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(mtcars, aes_string(x = input$xvar, y = input$yvar)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      labs(title = paste(\"Scatter plot of\", input$xvar, \"vs\", input$yvar))\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nEnhanced Mtcars App\n\n\nIn this enhanced version:\n\nWe replaced fluidPage with semanticPage to utilize Semantic UI.\nWe used segment and sidebar_layout to structure the UI components.\nThe overall look is more modern and visually appealing compared to the default Shiny components.\n\n\n\n\nFor more complex applications that require a dashboard layout, semantic.dashboard offers powerful tools to create sophisticated dashboards with ease. It extends shiny.semantic and adds pre-styled dashboard components.\nHere’s an example of a dashboard layout for our mtcars app:\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(semantic.dashboard)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Define the UI with semantic.dashboard\nui &lt;- dashboardPage(\n  dashboardHeader(title = \"Mtcars Dashboard\"),\n  dashboardSidebar(\n    sidebarMenu(\n      menuItem(\"Dashboard\", tabName = \"dashboard\", icon = icon(\"dashboard\")),\n      menuItem(\"Data Explorer\", tabName = \"dataexplorer\", icon = icon(\"table\"))\n    )\n  ),\n  dashboardBody(\n    tabItems(\n      tabItem(tabName = \"dashboard\",\n              fluidRow(\n                box(title = \"Controls\", width = 4, \n                    selectInput(\"xvar\", \"X-axis variable\", choices = names(mtcars)),\n                    selectInput(\"yvar\", \"Y-axis variable\", choices = names(mtcars), selected = \"mpg\")\n                ),\n                box(title = \"Scatter Plot\", width = 8, plotOutput(\"scatterPlot\"))\n              )\n      ),\n      tabItem(tabName = \"dataexplorer\",\n              dataTableOutput(\"dataTable\")\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define the server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  output$scatterPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(mtcars, aes_string(x = input$xvar, y = input$yvar)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      labs(title = paste(\"Scatter plot of\", input$xvar, \"vs\", input$yvar))\n  })\n  \n  output$dataTable &lt;- renderDataTable({\n    mtcars\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nMtcars Dashboard\n\n\nIn this dashboard version:\n\nWe used dashboardPage, dashboardHeader, dashboardSidebar, and dashboardBody to create a structured layout.\nThe sidebar contains a menu for navigation.\nThe body is divided into two tabs: one for the scatter plot and one for exploring the data table.\n\n\n\n\nshiny.fluent integrates Microsoft’s Fluent UI into Shiny applications, providing a rich set of controls and styles. It is particularly useful for creating applications with a Microsoft Office-like feel.\nHere’s how you can use shiny.fluent to enhance the mtcars app:\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(shiny.fluent)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Define the UI with shiny.fluent\nui &lt;- fluentPage(\n  Text(variant = \"xxLarge\", content = \"Mtcars Dataset Explorer\"),\n  Stack(\n    tokens = list(childrenGap = 10),\n    Dropdown.shinyInput(\"xvar\", label = \"X-axis variable\", \n                        options = lapply(names(mtcars), function(x) list(key = x, text = x)),\n                        value = \"mpg\"),\n    Dropdown.shinyInput(\"yvar\", label = \"Y-axis variable\", \n                        options = lapply(names(mtcars), function(x) list(key = x, text = x)),\n                        value = \"hp\"),\n    plotOutput(\"scatterPlot\")\n  )\n)\n\n# Define the server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  output$scatterPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(mtcars, aes_string(x = input$xvar, y = input$yvar)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      labs(title = paste(\"Scatter plot of\", input$xvar, \"vs\", input$yvar))\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nFluent UI Mtcars App\n\n\nIn this example:\n\nDropdown.shinyInput is used to create dropdowns for the x-axis and y-axis variables.\nThe Dropdown component’s options argument is correctly set up with key and text fields.\nplotOutput is used to display the scatter plot.\nThe server logic captures the input selections and updates the plot accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nEnsuring that your applications are accessible and user-friendly is crucial. Here are some tips:\n\nUse shiny.i18n for Internationalization: shiny.i18n makes it easy to translate your Shiny apps into multiple languages, ensuring they are accessible to a broader audience.\nConsistent Styling: Maintain consistent styles across your application for a professional look and feel.\nResponsive Design: Ensure your app works well on different devices and screen sizes.\n\nBy leveraging these Appsilon packages, you can create visually appealing, user-friendly, and highly interactive Shiny applications. In the next chapter, we will delve into advanced reactivity and routing, further enhancing the interactivity and user experience of your applications.\n\n\n\nWith a solid understanding of Shiny’s core capabilities and how to enhance the UI using Appsilon’s styling packages, it’s time to delve into more advanced features. This chapter focuses on leveraging advanced reactivity with shiny.react and implementing efficient navigation using shiny.router. These tools will help you create more dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly applications.\n\n\n\nshiny.react is a package that brings the power of React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, into Shiny. By using shiny.react, you can create highly responsive and interactive components that enhance the user experience.\nLet’s enhance our previous mtcars app with shiny.react to add more responsive components:\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(shiny.react)\nlibrary(shiny.fluent)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Define the UI with shiny.react and shiny.fluent\nui &lt;- fluentPage(\n  Text(variant = \"xxLarge\", content = \"Mtcars Dataset Explorer\"),\n  Stack(\n    tokens = list(childrenGap = 10),\n    Dropdown.shinyInput(\"xvar\", label = \"X-axis variable\", \n                        options = lapply(names(mtcars), function(x) list(key = x, text = x)),\n                        value = \"mpg\"),\n    Dropdown.shinyInput(\"yvar\", label = \"Y-axis variable\", \n                        options = lapply(names(mtcars), function(x) list(key = x, text = x)),\n                        value = \"hp\"),\n    plotOutput(\"scatterPlot\")\n  )\n)\n\n# Define the server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  output$scatterPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(mtcars, aes_string(x = input$xvar, y = input$yvar)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      labs(title = paste(\"Scatter plot of\", input$xvar, \"vs\", input$yvar))\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\nIn this code:\n\nDropdown.shinyInput is used to create dropdown inputs, integrating Fluent UI with Shiny reactivity.\nThe Dropdown component’s options argument is correctly set up with key and text fields.\nThe fluentPage function is used to structure the UI.\n\n\n\n\nAs your Shiny applications grow in complexity, managing navigation and routing becomes crucial. shiny.router is a package that provides a simple way to add routing to your Shiny apps, allowing you to create single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple views.\n\n\n\nWith the basics of Shiny and enhanced UI elements covered, it’s time to delve into the core functionality that makes Shiny a powerful tool for data science and visualization. In this chapter, we will explore how to handle data within Shiny applications, create dynamic reports, and integrate advanced visualization libraries to provide insightful and interactive data presentations.\n\n\n\nEfficient data handling is crucial for any Shiny application, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex analyses. Shiny provides several mechanisms to manage data effectively, including reactive expressions and data caching.\n\n\n\nReactivity is at the heart of Shiny, allowing applications to respond to user inputs dynamically. Here’s an example of how to use reactive expressions to handle data in Shiny:\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Define UI\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"Reactive Data Example\"),\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      numericInput(\"obs\", \"Number of observations:\", 1000, min = 1, max = 10000)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  # Reactive expression to generate random data\n  data &lt;- reactive({\n    rnorm(input$obs)\n  })\n  \n  # Render plot\n  output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(data.frame(x = data()), aes(x)) +\n      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) +\n      labs(title = \"Histogram of Randomly Generated Data\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nReactive Data Example\n\n\nIn this example:\n\nA numericInput allows the user to specify the number of observations.\nA reactive expression data() generates random data based on the user input.\nThe renderPlot function uses this reactive data to generate and display a histogram.\n\n\n\n\nShiny can be combined with rmarkdown and knitr to create dynamic reports that update based on user inputs. This is particularly useful for generating customized reports on the fly.\nHere’s an example of a simple Shiny app that generates a report using rmarkdown:\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\n\n# Define UI\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"Dynamic Report Example\"),\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      numericInput(\"obs\", \"Number of observations:\", 1000, min = 1, max = 10000),\n      downloadButton(\"report\", \"Generate Report\")\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  # Reactive expression to generate random data\n  data &lt;- reactive({\n    rnorm(input$obs)\n  })\n  \n  # Render plot\n  output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(data.frame(x = data()), aes(x)) +\n      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) +\n      labs(title = \"Histogram of Randomly Generated Data\")\n  })\n  \n  # Generate report\n  output$report &lt;- downloadHandler(\n    filename = function() {\n      paste(\"report-\", Sys.Date(), \".html\", sep = \"\")\n    },\n    content = function(file) {\n      tempReport &lt;- file.path(tempdir(), \"report.Rmd\")\n      file.copy(\"report.Rmd\", tempReport, overwrite = TRUE)\n      \n      params &lt;- list(obs = input$obs)\n      \n      rmarkdown::render(tempReport, output_file = file,\n                        params = params,\n                        envir = new.env(parent = globalenv()))\n    }\n  )\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nDynamic Report Example\n\n\nFor this example to work, you’ll need a report.Rmd file in your working directory with the following content:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Dynamic Report\"\noutput: html_document\nparams:\n  obs: 1\n---\n\n\n```r\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n## Report\nThis report was generated dynamically using rmarkdown.\n\nThe number of observations selected was `r params$obs`.\n\n```r\ndata &lt;- rnorm(params$obs)\nhist(data, main = \"Histogram of Randomly Generated Data\")\n```\n\n\n\nEnhancing your Shiny applications with Appsilon’s powerful extensions can significantly improve functionality, usability, and visual appeal.

    "text": "222222222222222222222222222222222222222 \n ### Lessons from Will Hunting and McGayver\nIn the world of data science, data cleaning is often seen as one of the most time-consuming and least glamorous tasks. Yet, it’s also one of the most critical. Without clean data, even the most sophisticated algorithms and models can produce misleading results. This is where the janitor package in R comes into play, serving as the unsung hero that quietly handles the nitty-gritty work of preparing data for analysis.\nMuch like the janitors we often overlook in our daily lives, the janitor package works behind the scenes to ensure everything runs smoothly. It takes care of the small but essential tasks that, if neglected, could bring a project to a halt. The package simplifies data cleaning with a set of intuitive functions that are both powerful and easy to use, making it an indispensable tool for any data scientist.\nTo better understand the importance of janitor, we can draw parallels to two iconic figures from pop culture: Will Hunting, the genius janitor from Good Will Hunting, and McGayver, the handyman known for his ability to solve any problem with minimal resources. Just as Will Hunting and McGayver possess hidden talents that make a huge impact, the janitor package holds a set of powerful functions that can transform messy datasets into clean, manageable ones, enabling data scientists to focus on the more complex aspects of their work.\n\nWill Hunting: The Genius Janitor\nWill Hunting, the protagonist of Good Will Hunting, is an unassuming janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Despite his modest job, Will possesses a genius-level intellect, particularly in mathematics. His hidden talent is discovered when he solves a complex math problem left on a blackboard, something that had stumped even the brightest minds at the university. This revelation sets off a journey that challenges his self-perception and the expectations of those around him.\nThe story of Will Hunting is a perfect metaphor for the janitor package in R. Just as Will performs crucial tasks behind the scenes at MIT, the janitor package operates in the background of data science projects. It handles the essential, albeit often overlooked, work of data cleaning, ensuring that data is in the best possible shape for analysis. Like Will, who is initially underestimated but ultimately proves invaluable, janitor is a tool that may seem simple at first glance but is incredibly powerful and essential for any serious data scientist.\nWithout proper data cleaning, even the most advanced statistical models can produce incorrect or misleading results. The janitor package, much like Will Hunting, quietly ensures that the foundations are solid, allowing the more complex and visible work to shine.\n\n\nMcGayver: The Handyman Who Fixes Everything\nIn your school days, you might have known someone who was a jack-of-all-trades, able to fix anything with whatever tools or materials were on hand. Perhaps this person was affectionately nicknamed “McGayver,” a nod to the famous TV character MacGyver, who was known for solving complex problems with everyday objects. This school janitor, like McGayver, was indispensable — working in the background, fixing leaks, unclogging drains, and keeping everything running smoothly. Without him, things would quickly fall apart.\nThis is exactly how the janitor package functions in the world of data science. Just as your school’s McGayver could solve any problem with a handful of tools, the janitor package offers a set of versatile functions that can clean up the messiest of datasets with minimal effort. Whether it’s removing empty rows and columns, cleaning up column names, or handling duplicates, janitor has a tool for the job. And much like McGayver, it accomplishes these tasks efficiently and effectively, often with a single line of code.\nThe genius of McGayver wasn’t just in his ability to fix things, but in how he could use simple tools to do so. In the same way, janitor simplifies tasks that might otherwise require complex code or multiple steps. It allows data scientists to focus on the bigger picture, confident that the foundations of their data are solid.\n\n\nProblem-Solving with and without janitor\nIn this section, we’ll dive into specific data cleaning problems that data scientists frequently encounter. For each problem, we’ll first show how it can be solved using base R, and then demonstrate how the janitor package offers a more streamlined and efficient solution.\n\n1. clean_names(): Tidying Up Column Names\nProblem:\nColumn names in datasets are often messy — containing spaces, special characters, or inconsistent capitalization — which can make data manipulation challenging. Consistent, tidy column names are essential for smooth data analysis.\nBase R Solution: To clean column names manually, you would need to perform several steps, such as converting names to lowercase, replacing spaces with underscores, and removing special characters. Here’s an example using base R:\n# Creating dummy empty data frame\ndf = data.frame(a = NA, b = NA, c = NA, d = NA)\n\n# Original column names\nnames(df) &lt;- c(\"First Name\", \"Last Name\", \"Email Address\", \"Phone Number\")\n\n# Cleaning the names manually\nnames(df) &lt;- tolower(names(df))                        # Convert to lowercase\nnames(df) &lt;- gsub(\" \", \"_\", names(df))                 # Replace spaces with underscores\nnames(df) &lt;- gsub(\"[^[:alnum:]_]\", \"\", names(df))      # Remove special characters\n\n# Resulting column names\nnames(df)\n# [1] \"first_name\" \"last_name\" \"email_address\" \"phone_number\"\nThis approach requires multiple lines of code, each handling a different aspect of cleaning.\njanitor Solution: With the janitor package, the same result can be achieved with a single function:\n# creating dummy empty data frame\ndf = data.frame(a = NA, b = NA, c = NA, d = NA)\nnames(df) &lt;- c(\"First Name\", \"Last Name\", \"Email Address\", \"Phone Number\")\n\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n# Using clean_names() to tidy up column names\ndf &lt;- clean_names(df)\n\n# Resulting column names\nnames(df)\n# [1] \"first_name\" \"last_name\" \"email_address\" \"phone_number\"\nWhy janitor Is Better: The clean_names() function simplifies the entire process into one step, automatically applying a set of best practices to clean and standardize column names. This not only saves time but also reduces the chance of making errors in your code. By using clean_names(), you ensure that your column names are consistently formatted and ready for analysis, without the need for manual intervention.\n\n\n2. tabyl and adorn_ Functions: Creating Frequency Tables and Adding Totals or Percentages\nProblem:\nWhen analyzing categorical data, it’s common to create frequency tables or cross-tabulations. Additionally, you might want to add totals or percentages to these tables to get a clearer picture of your data distribution.\nBase R Solution: Creating a frequency table and adding totals or percentages manually requires several steps. Here’s an example using base R:\n# Sample data\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  gender = c(\"Male\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\"),\n  age_group = c(\"18-24\", \"18-24\", \"25-34\", \"25-34\", \"35-44\")\n)\n\n# Creating a frequency table using base R\ntable(df$gender, df$age_group)\n\n#        18-24 25-34 35-44\n# Female     1     1     1\n# Male       1     1     0\n\n# Adding row totals\naddmargins(table(df$gender, df$age_group), margin = 1)\n\n#         18-24 25-34 35-44\n# Female     1     1     1\n# Male       1     1     0\n# Sum        2     2     1\n\n# Calculating percentages\nprop.table(table(df$gender, df$age_group), margin = 1) * 100\n\n#           18-24    25-34    35-44\n# Female 33.33333 33.33333 33.33333\n# Male   50.00000 50.00000  0.00000\nThis method involves creating tables, adding margins manually, and calculating percentages separately, which can become cumbersome, especially with larger datasets.\njanitor Solution: With the janitor package, you can create a frequency table and easily add totals or percentages using tabyl() and adorn_* functions:\n# Sample data\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  gender = c(\"Male\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\"),\n  age_group = c(\"18-24\", \"18-24\", \"25-34\", \"25-34\", \"35-44\")\n)\n\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n# Piping all together\ntable_df &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  tabyl(gender, age_group) %&gt;%\n  adorn_totals(\"row\") %&gt;%\n  adorn_percentages(\"row\") %&gt;%\n  adorn_pct_formatting()\n\ntable_df\n\n# gender 18-24 25-34 35-44\n# Female 33.3% 33.3% 33.3%\n#   Male 50.0% 50.0%  0.0%\n#  Total 40.0% 40.0% 20.0%\nWhy janitor Is Better: The tabyl() function automatically generates a clean frequency table, while adorn_totals() and adorn_percentages() easily add totals and percentages without the need for additional code. This approach is not only quicker but also reduces the complexity of your code. The janitor functions handle the formatting and calculations for you, making it easier to produce professional-looking tables that are ready for reporting or further analysis.\n\n\n3. row_to_names(): Converting a Row of Data into Column Names\nProblem:\nSometimes, datasets are structured with the actual column names stored in one of the rows rather than the header. Before starting the analysis, you need to promote this row to be the header of the data frame.\nBase R Solution: Without janitor, converting a row to column names can be done with the following steps using base R:\n# Sample data with column names in the first row\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  X1 = c(\"Name\", \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Doe\"),\n  X2 = c(\"Age\", \"25\", \"30\", \"22\"),\n  X3 = c(\"Gender\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\")\n)\n\n# Step 1: Extract the first row as column names\ncolnames(df) &lt;- df[1, ]\n\n# Step 2: Remove the first row from the data frame\ndf &lt;- df[-1, ]\n\n# Resulting data frame\ndf\nThis method involves manually extracting the row, assigning it as the header, and then removing the original row from the data.\njanitor Solution: With janitor, this entire process is streamlined into a single function:\n# Sample data with column names in the first row\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  X1 = c(\"Name\", \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Doe\"),\n  X2 = c(\"Age\", \"25\", \"30\", \"22\"),\n  X3 = c(\"Gender\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\")\n)\n\ndf &lt;- row_to_names(df, row_number = 1)\n\n# Resulting data frame\ndf\nWhy janitor Is Better: The row_to_names() function from janitor simplifies this operation by directly promoting the specified row to the header in one go, eliminating the need for multiple steps. This function is more intuitive and reduces the chance of errors, allowing you to quickly structure your data correctly and move on to analysis.\n\n\n4. remove_constant(): Identifying and Removing Columns with Constant Values\nProblem:\nIn some datasets, certain columns may contain the same value across all rows. These constant columns provide no useful information for analysis and can clutter your dataset. Removing them is essential for streamlining your data.\nBase R Solution: Identifying and removing constant columns without janitor requires writing a custom function or applying several steps. Here’s an example using base R:\n# Sample data with constant and variable columns\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n  Gender = c(\"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\"), # Constant column\n  Age = c(25, 30, 22, 40, 35)\n)\n\n# Identifying constant columns manually\nconstant_cols &lt;- sapply(df, function(col) length(unique(col)) == 1)\n\n# Removing constant columns\ndf &lt;- df[, !constant_cols]\n\n# Resulting data frame\ndf\n\n  ID Age\n1  1  25\n2  2  30\n3  3  22\n4  4  40\n5  5  35\nThis method involves checking each column for unique values and then filtering out the constant ones, which can be cumbersome.\njanitor Solution: With janitor, you can achieve the same result with a simple, one-line function:\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n  Gender = c(\"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\"), # Constant column\n  Age = c(25, 30, 22, 40, 35)\n)\n\ndf &lt;- remove_constant(df)\n\n  ID Age\n1  1  25\n2  2  30\n3  3  22\n4  4  40\n5  5  35\nWhy janitor Is Better: The remove_constant() function from janitor is a straightforward and efficient solution to remove constant columns. It automates the process, ensuring that no valuable time is wasted on writing custom functions or manually filtering columns. This function is particularly useful when working with large datasets, where manually identifying constant columns would be impractical.\n\n\n5. remove_empty(): Eliminating Empty Rows and Columns\nProblem:\nDatasets often contain rows or columns that are entirely empty, especially after merging or importing data from various sources. These empty rows and columns don’t contribute any useful information and can complicate data analysis, so they should be removed.\nBase R Solution: Manually identifying and removing empty rows and columns can be done, but it requires multiple steps. Here’s how you might approach it using base R:\n# Sample data with empty rows and columns\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5),\n  Name = c(\"John\", \"Jane\", NA, NA,NA),\n  Age = c(25, 30, NA, NA, NA),\n  Empty_Col = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA) # An empty column\n)\n\n# Removing empty rows\ndf &lt;- df[rowSums(is.na(df)) != ncol(df), ]\n\n# Removing empty columns\ndf &lt;- df[, colSums(is.na(df)) != nrow(df)]\n\n# Resulting data frame\ndf\n\n  ID Name Age\n1  1 John  25\n2  2 Jane  30\n4  4 &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n5  5 &lt;NA&gt;  NA\nThis method involves checking each row and column for completeness and then filtering out those that are entirely empty, which can be cumbersome and prone to error.\njanitor Solution: With janitor, you can remove both empty rows and columns in a single, straightforward function call:\n# Sample data with empty rows and columns\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5),\n  Name = c(\"John\", \"Jane\", NA, NA,NA),\n  Age = c(25, 30, NA, NA, NA),\n  Empty_Col = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA) # An empty column\n)\n\ndf &lt;- remove_empty(df, which = c(\"cols\", \"rows\"))\n\ndf\n\n  ID Name Age\n1  1 John  25\n2  2 Jane  30\n4  4 &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n5  5 &lt;NA&gt;  NA\nWhy janitor Is Better: The remove_empty() function from janitor makes it easy to eliminate empty rows and columns with minimal effort. You can specify whether you want to remove just rows, just columns, or both, making the process more flexible and less error-prone. This one-line solution significantly simplifies the task and ensures that your dataset is clean and ready for analysis.\n\n\n6. get_dupes(): Detecting and Extracting Duplicate Rows\nProblem:\nDuplicate rows in a dataset can lead to biased or incorrect analysis results. Identifying and managing duplicates is crucial to ensure the integrity of your data.\nBase R Solution: Detecting and extracting duplicate rows manually can be done using base R with the following approach:\n# Sample data with duplicate rows\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5),\n  Name = c(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Doe\", \"Doe\", \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Bob\"),\n  Age = c(25, 30, 22, 22, 40, 35, 35)\n)\n\n# Identifying duplicate rows\ndupes &lt;- df[duplicated(df) | duplicated(df, fromLast = TRUE), ]\n\n# Resulting data frame with duplicates\ndupes\n\nID Name Age\n3  3  Doe  22\n4  3  Doe  22\n6  5  Bob  35\n7  5  Bob  35\nThis approach uses duplicated() to identify duplicate rows. While it’s effective, it requires careful handling to ensure all duplicates are correctly identified and extracted, especially in more complex datasets.\njanitor Solution: With janitor, identifying and extracting duplicate rows is greatly simplified using the get_dupes() function:\n# Sample data with duplicate rows\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5),\n  Name = c(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Doe\", \"Doe\", \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Bob\"),\n  Age = c(25, 30, 22, 22, 40, 35, 35)\n)\n\n# Using get_dupes() to find duplicate rows\ndupes &lt;- get_dupes(df)\n\n# Resulting data frame with duplicates\ndupes\n\n# It gives us additional info how many repeats of each row we have\n  ID Name Age dupe_count\n1  3  Doe  22          2\n2  3  Doe  22          2\n3  5  Bob  35          2\n4  5  Bob  35          2\nWhy janitor Is Better: The get_dupes() function from janitor not only identifies duplicate rows but also provides additional information, such as the number of times each duplicate appears, in an easy-to-read format. This functionality is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, where even a straightforward method like duplicated() can become cumbersome. With get_dupes(), you gain a more detailed and user-friendly overview of duplicates, ensuring the integrity of your data.\n\n\n7. round_half_up, signif_half_up, and round_to_fraction: Rounding Numbers with Precision\nProblem:\nRounding numbers is a common task in data analysis, but different situations require different types of rounding. Sometimes you need to round to the nearest integer, other times to a specific fraction, or you might need to ensure that rounding is consistent in cases like 5.5 rounding up to 6.\nBase R Solution: Rounding numbers in base R can be done using round() or signif(), but these functions don't always handle edge cases or specific requirements like rounding half up or to a specific fraction:\n# Sample data\nnumbers &lt;- c(1.25, 2.5, 3.75, 4.125, 5.5)\n\n# Rounding using base R's round() function\nrounded &lt;- round(numbers, 1)  # Rounds to one decimal place\n\n# Rounding to significant digits using signif()\nsignificant &lt;- signif(numbers, 2)\n\n# Resulting rounded values\n\nrounded\n[1] 1.2 2.5 3.8 4.1 5.5\n\nsignificant\n[1] 1.2 2.5 3.8 4.1 5.5\nWhile these functions are useful, they may not provide the exact rounding behavior you need in certain situations, such as consistently rounding half values up or rounding to specific fractions.\njanitor Solution: The janitor package provides specialized functions like round_half_up(), signif_half_up(), and round_to_fraction() to handle these cases with precision:\n# Using round_half_up() to round numbers with half up logic\nrounded_half_up &lt;- round_half_up(numbers, 1)\n\n# Using signif_half_up() to round to significant digits with half up logic\nsignificant_half_up &lt;- signif_half_up(numbers, 2)\n\n# Using round_to_fraction() to round numbers to the nearest fraction\nrounded_fraction &lt;- round_to_fraction(numbers, denominator = 4)\n\nrounded_half_up\n[1] 1.3 2.5 3.8 4.1 5.5\n\nsignificant_half_up\n[1] 1.3 2.5 3.8 4.1 5.5\n\nrounded_fraction\n[1] 1.25 2.50 3.75 4.00 5.50\nWhy janitor Is Better: The janitor functions round_half_up(), signif_half_up(), and round_to_fraction() offer more precise control over rounding operations compared to base R functions. These functions are particularly useful when you need to ensure consistent rounding behavior, such as always rounding 5.5 up to 6, or when rounding to the nearest fraction (e.g., quarter or eighth). This level of control can be critical in scenarios where rounding consistency affects the outcome of an analysis or report.\n\n\n8. chisq.test() and fisher.test(): Simplifying Hypothesis Testing\nProblem:\nWhen working with categorical data, it’s often necessary to test for associations between variables using statistical tests like the Chi-squared test (chisq.test()) or Fisher’s exact test (fisher.test()). Preparing your data and setting up these tests manually can be complex, particularly when dealing with larger datasets with multiple categories.\nBase R Solution: Here’s how you might approach this using a more complex dataset with base R:\n# Sample data with multiple categories\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  Treatment = c(\"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\", \"C\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"),\n  Outcome = c(\"Success\", \"Failure\", \"Success\", \"Failure\", \"Success\", \"Failure\",\n              \"Success\", \"Success\", \"Failure\", \"Failure\", \"Success\", \"Failure\"),\n  Gender = c(\"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\",\n             \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\")\n)\n\n# Creating a contingency table\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(df$Treatment, df$Outcome, df$Gender)\n\n# Performing Chi-squared test (on a 2D slice of the table)\nchisq_result &lt;- chisq.test(contingency_table[,, \"Male\"])\n\n# Performing Fisher's exact test (on the same 2D slice)\nfisher_result &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_table[,, \"Male\"])\n\n# Results\nchisq_result\n\n Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  contingency_table[, , \"Male\"]\nX-squared = 2.4, df = 2, p-value = 0.3012\n\nfisher_result\n\n Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table[, , \"Male\"]\np-value = 1\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\nThis approach involves creating a multidimensional contingency table and then slicing it to apply the tests. This can become cumbersome and requires careful management of the data structure.\njanitor Solution: Using janitor, you can achieve the same results with a more straightforward approach:\n# Sample data with multiple categories\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  Treatment = c(\"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\", \"C\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"),\n  Outcome = c(\"Success\", \"Failure\", \"Success\", \"Failure\", \"Success\", \"Failure\",\n              \"Success\", \"Success\", \"Failure\", \"Failure\", \"Success\", \"Failure\"),\n  Gender = c(\"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\",\n             \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\")\n)\n\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n# Creating a tabyl to perform Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests for Male participants\ndf_male &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(Gender == \"Male\") %&gt;%\n  tabyl(Treatment, Outcome)\n\n# Performing Chi-squared test\nchisq_result &lt;- chisq.test(df_male)\n\n# Performing Fisher's exact test\nfisher_result &lt;- fisher.test(df_male)\n\n# Results\nchisq_result\n\n Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  df_male\nX-squared = 2.4, df = 2, p-value = 0.3012\n\nfisher_result\n\n Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  df_male\np-value = 1\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\nWhy janitor Is Better: The janitor approach simplifies the process by integrating the creation of contingency tables (tabyl()) with the execution of hypothesis tests (chisq.test() and fisher.test()). This reduces the need for manual data slicing and ensures that the data is correctly formatted for testing. This streamlined process is particularly advantageous when dealing with larger, more complex datasets, where manually managing the structure could lead to errors. The result is a faster, more reliable workflow for testing associations between categorical variables.\n\n\n\nThe Unsung Heroes of Data Science\nIn both the physical world and the realm of data science, there are tasks that often go unnoticed but are crucial for the smooth operation of larger systems. Janitors, for example, quietly maintain the cleanliness and functionality of buildings, ensuring that everyone else can work comfortably and efficiently. Without their efforts, even the most well-designed spaces would quickly descend into chaos.\nSimilarly, the janitor package in R plays an essential, yet often underappreciated, role in data science. Data cleaning might not be the most glamorous aspect of data analysis, but it’s undoubtedly one of the most critical. Just as a building cannot function properly without regular maintenance, a data analysis project cannot yield reliable results without clean, well-prepared data.\nThe functions provided by the janitor package — whether it’s tidying up column names, removing duplicates, or simplifying complex rounding tasks — are the data science equivalent of the work done by janitors and handymen in the physical world. They ensure that the foundational aspects of your data are in order, allowing you to focus on the more complex, creative aspects of analysis and interpretation.\nReliable data cleaning is not just about making datasets look neat; it’s about ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the insights derived from that data. Inaccurate or inconsistent data can lead to flawed conclusions, which can have significant consequences in any field — from business decisions to scientific research. By automating and simplifying the data cleaning process, the janitor package helps prevent such issues, ensuring that the results of your analysis are as robust and trustworthy as possible.\nIn short, while the janitor package may work quietly behind the scenes, its impact on the overall success of data science projects is profound. It is the unsung hero that keeps your data — and, by extension, your entire analysis — on solid ground.\nThroughout this article, we’ve delved into how the janitor package in R serves as an indispensable tool for data cleaning, much like the often-overlooked but essential janitors and handymen in our daily lives. By comparing its functions to traditional methods using base R, we’ve demonstrated how janitor simplifies and streamlines tasks that are crucial for any data analysis project.\nThe story of Will Hunting, the genius janitor, and the analogy of your school’s “McGayver” highlight how unnoticed figures can make extraordinary contributions with their unique skills. Similarly, the janitor package, though it operates quietly in the background, has a significant impact on data preparation. It handles the nitty-gritty tasks — cleaning column names, removing duplicates, rounding numbers precisely — allowing data scientists to focus on generating insights and building models.\nWe also explored how functions like clean_names(), tabyl(), row_to_names(), remove_constants(), remove_empty(), get_dupes(), and round_half_up() drastically reduce the effort required to prepare your data. These tools save time, ensure data consistency, and minimize errors, making them indispensable for any data professional.\nMoreover, we emphasized the critical role of data cleaning in ensuring reliable analysis outcomes. Just as no building can function without the janitors who maintain it, no data science workflow should be without tools like the janitor package. It is the unsung hero that ensures your data is ready for meaningful analysis, enabling you to trust your results and make sound decisions.\nIn summary, the janitor package is more than just a set of utility functions — it’s a crucial ally in the data scientist’s toolkit. By handling the essential, behind-the-scenes work of data cleaning, janitor helps ensure that your analyses are built on a solid foundation. So, if you haven’t already integrated janitor into your workflow, now is the perfect time to explore its capabilities and see how it can elevate your data preparation process.\nConsider adding janitor to your R toolkit today. Explore its functions and experience firsthand how it can streamline your workflow and enhance the quality of your data analysis.

    "section": "",
    "text": "purrr image\n\n\nWelcome back to the world of purrr! Last time (about a year ago), we spun a metaphorical yarn about the wonders of purrr in R. Today, we’re rolling up our sleeves and diving into a hands-on tutorial. We’re going to explore how purrr makes working with lists and vectors a breeze, transforming and manipulating them like a data wizard.\nWith purrr, you can apply functions to each element of a list or vector, manipulate them, check conditions, and so much more. It’s all about making your data dance to your commands with elegance and efficiency. Ready to unleash some functional magic?\n\nAre map Functions Like apply Functions?\nYou might be wondering, “Aren’t map functions just fancy versions of apply functions?” It’s a fair question! Both map and apply functions help you apply a function to elements in a data structure, but purrr takes it to a whole new level.\nHere’s why purrr and its map functions are worth your attention:\n\nConsistency: purrr functions have a consistent naming scheme, making them easier to learn and remember.\nType Safety: map functions in purrr return outputs of consistent types, reducing unexpected errors.\nIntegration: Seamlessly integrate with other tidyverse packages, making your data wrangling pipeline smoother.\n\nLet’s see a quick comparison:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Using lapply (base R)\nnumbers &lt;- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nsquared_lapply &lt;- lapply(numbers, function(x) x^2)\n\n# Using map (purrr)\nsquared_map &lt;- map(numbers, ~ .x^2)\n\nprint(squared_lapply)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 9\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 16\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 25\n\nprint(squared_map)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 9\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 16\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 25\nBoth do the same thing, but purrr’s map function is more readable and concise, especially when paired with the tidyverse syntax.\nHere’s another example with a built-in dataset:\n# Using lapply with a built-in dataset\niris_split &lt;- split(iris, iris$Species)\nmean_sepal_length_lapply &lt;- lapply(iris_split, function(df) mean(df$Sepal.Length))\n\n# Using map with a built-in dataset\nmean_sepal_length_map &lt;- map(iris_split, ~ mean(.x$Sepal.Length))\n\nprint(mean_sepal_length_lapply)\n\n$setosa\n[1] 5.006\n\n$versicolor\n[1] 5.936\n\n$virginica\n[1] 6.588\n\nprint(mean_sepal_length_map)\n\n$setosa\n[1] 5.006\n\n$versicolor\n[1] 5.936\n\n$virginica\n[1] 6.588\nAgain, the purrr version is cleaner and easier to understand at a glance.\nConvinced? Let’s move on to explore simple maps and their variants to see more of purrr’s magic. Ready?\n\n\nSimple Maps and Their Variants\nNow that we know why purrr’s map functions are so cool, let’s dive into some practical examples. The map function family is like a Swiss Army knife for data transformation. It comes in different flavors depending on the type of output you want: logical, integer, character, or double.\nLet’s start with the basic map function:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Basic map example\nnumbers &lt;- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nsquared_numbers &lt;- map(numbers, ~ .x^2)\nsquared_numbers\nEasy, right? Yes, but we have one twist here. Result is returned as list, and we don’t always need list. So now, let’s look at the type-specific variants. These functions ensure that the output is of a specific type, which can help avoid unexpected surprises in your data processing pipeline.\n\nLogical (map_lgl):\n\n# Check if each number is even\nis_even &lt;- map_lgl(numbers, ~ .x %% 2 == 0)\nis_even\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n# it is not list anymore, it is logical vector\n\nInteger (map_int):\n\n# Double each number and return as integers\ndoubled_integers &lt;- map_int(numbers, ~ .x * 2)\ndoubled_integers\n\n[1]  2  4  6  8 10\n\nCharacter (map_chr):\n\n# Convert each number to a string\nnumber_strings &lt;- map_chr(numbers, ~ paste(\"Number\", .x))\nnumber_strings\n\n[1] \"Number 1\" \"Number 2\" \"Number 3\" \"Number 4\" \"Number 5\"\n\nDouble (map_dbl):\n\n# Half each number and return as doubles\nhalved_doubles &lt;- map_dbl(numbers, ~ .x / 2)\nhalved_doubles\n\n[1] 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\nLet’s apply this to a built-in dataset to see it in action:\n# Using map_dbl on the iris dataset to get the mean of each numeric column\niris_means &lt;- iris %&gt;%\n  select(-Species) %&gt;%\n  map_dbl(mean)\niris_means\n\nSepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width \n    5.843333     3.057333     3.758000     1.199333 \nHere, we’ve calculated the mean of each numeric column in the iris dataset, and the result is a named vector of doubles.\nPretty neat, huh? The map family makes it easy to ensure your data stays in the format you expect.\nReady to see how purrr handles multiple vectors with map2 and pmap?\n\n\nNot Only One Vector: map2 and pmap + Variants\nSo far, we’ve seen how map functions work with a single vector or list. But what if you have multiple vectors and want to apply a function to corresponding elements from each? Enter map2 and pmap.\n\nmap2: This function applies a function to corresponding elements of two vectors or lists.\npmap: This function applies a function to corresponding elements of multiple lists.\n\nLet’s start with map2:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Two vectors to work with\nvec1 &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nvec2 &lt;- c(4, 5, 6)\n\n# Adding corresponding elements of two vectors\nsum_vecs &lt;- map2(vec1, vec2, ~ .x + .y)\nsum_vecs\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 5\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 7\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 9\nHere, map2 takes elements from vec1 and vec2 and adds them together.\nNow, let’s step it up with pmap:\n# Creating a tibble for multiple lists\ndf &lt;- tibble(\n  a = 1:3,\n  b = 4:6,\n  c = 7:9\n)\n\n# Summing corresponding elements of multiple lists\nsum_pmap &lt;- pmap(df, ~ ..1 + ..2 + ..3)\nsum_pmap\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 12\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 15\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 18\nIn this example, pmap takes elements from columns a, b, and c of the tibble and sums them up.\nLook at syntax in those two examples. In map2, we give two vectors or lists, and then we are reffering to them as .x and .y. Further in pmap example we have data.frame, but it can be a list of lists, and we need to refer to them with numbers like ..1, ..2 and ..3 (and more if needed).\n\n\nVariants of map2 and pmap\nJust like map, map2 and pmap have type-specific variants. Let’s see a couple of examples using data structures already defined above:\n\nmap2_dbl:\n\n# Multiplying corresponding elements of two vectors and returning doubles\nproduct_vecs &lt;- map2_dbl(vec1, vec2, ~ .x * .y)\nproduct_vecs\n\n[1]  4 10 18\n\npmap_chr:\n\n# Concatenating corresponding elements of multiple lists into strings\nconcat_pmap &lt;- pmap_chr(df, ~ paste(..1, ..2, ..3, sep = \"-\"))\nconcat_pmap\n\n[1] \"1-4-7\" \"2-5-8\" \"3-6-9\"\nThese variants ensure that your results are of the expected type, just like the basic map variants.\nWith map2 and pmap, you can handle more complex data transformations involving multiple vectors or lists with ease.\nReady to move on and see what lmap and imap can do for you?\n\n\nUsing imap for Indexed Mapping and Conditional Maps with _if and _at\nLet’s combine our exploration of imap with the conditional mapping functions map_if and map_at. These functions give you more control over how and when functions are applied to your data, making your code more precise and expressive.\n\nimap: Indexed Mapping\nThe imap function is a handy tool when you need to include the index or names of elements in your function calls. This is particularly useful for tasks where the position or name of an element influences the operation performed on it.\nHere’s a practical example with a named list:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# A named list of scores\nnamed_scores &lt;- list(math = 90, science = 85, history = 78)\n\n# Create descriptive strings for each score\nscore_descriptions &lt;- imap(named_scores, ~ paste(.y, \"score is\", .x))\nscore_descriptions\n\n$math\n[1] \"math score is 90\"\n\n$science\n[1] \"science score is 85\"\n\n$history\n[1] \"history score is 78\"\nIn this example:\n\nWe have a named list named_scores with subject scores.\nWe use imap to create a descriptive string for each score that includes the subject name and the score.\n\n\n\nConditional Maps with map_if and map_at\nSometimes, you don’t want to apply a function to all elements of a list or vector — only to those that meet certain conditions. This is where map_if and map_at come into play.\nmap_if: Conditional Mapping\nUse map_if to apply a function to elements that satisfy a specific condition (predicate).\n# Mixed list of numbers and characters\nmixed_list &lt;- list(1, \"a\", 3, \"b\", 5)\n\n# Double only the numeric elements\ndoubled_numbers &lt;- map_if(mixed_list, is.numeric, ~ .x * 2)\ndoubled_numbers\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 2\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"a\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 6\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"b\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 10\nIn this example:\n\nWe have a mixed list of numbers and characters.\nWe use map_if to double only the numeric elements, leaving the characters unchanged.\n\nmap_at: Specific Element Mapping\nUse map_at to apply a function to specific elements of a list or vector, identified by their indices or names.\n# A named list of mixed types\nspecific_list &lt;- list(a = 1, b = \"hello\", c = 3, d = \"world\")\n\n# Convert only the character elements to uppercase\nuppercase_chars &lt;- map_at(specific_list, c(\"b\", \"d\"), ~ toupper(.x))\nuppercase_chars\n\n$a\n[1] 1\n\n$b\n[1] \"HELLO\"\n\n$c\n[1] 3\n\n$d\n[1] \"WORLD\"\nIn this example:\n\nWe have a named list with mixed types.\nWe use map_at to convert only the specified character elements to uppercase.\n\nCombining imap, map_if, and map_at allows you to handle complex data transformation tasks with precision and clarity. These functions make it easy to tailor your operations to the specific needs of your data.\nShall we move on to the next chapter to explore walk and its friends for side-effect operations?\n\n\n\nMake Something Happen Outside of Data: walk and Its Friends\nSometimes, you want to perform operations that have side effects, like printing, writing to a file, or plotting, rather than returning a transformed list or vector. This is where the walk family of functions comes in handy. These functions are designed to be used for their side effects, as they return NULL.\n\nwalk\nThe basic walk function applies a function to each element of a list or vector and performs actions like printing or saving files.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# A list of numbers\nnumbers &lt;- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Print each number\nwalk(numbers, ~ print(.x))\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\nIn this example, walk prints each element of the numbers list.\n\n\nwalk2\nWhen you have two lists or vectors and you want to perform side-effect operations on their corresponding elements, walk2 is your friend.\n# Two vectors to work with\nvec1 &lt;- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\nvec2 &lt;- c(\"red\", \"yellow\", \"dark red\")\n\n# Print each fruit with its color\nwalk2(vec1, vec2, ~ cat(.x, \"is\", .y, \"\\n\"))\n\napple is red \nbanana is yellow \ncherry is dark red \nHere, walk2 prints each fruit with its corresponding color.\n\n\niwalk\niwalk is the side-effect version of imap. It includes the index or names of the elements, which can be useful for logging or debugging.\n# A named list of scores\nnamed_scores &lt;- list(math = 90, science = 85, history = 78)\n\n# Print each subject with its score\niwalk(named_scores, ~ cat(\"The score for\", .y, \"is\", .x, \"\\n\"))\n\nThe score for math is 90 \nThe score for science is 85 \nThe score for history is 78 \nIn this example, iwalk prints each subject name with its corresponding score.\n\n\nPractical Example with Built-in Data\nLet’s use a built-in dataset and perform some side-effect operations. Suppose you want to save plots of each numeric column in the mtcars dataset to separate files.\n# Directory to save plots\ndir.create(\"plots\")\n\n# Save histograms of each numeric column to files\nwalk(names(mtcars), ~ {\n  if (is.numeric(mtcars[[.x]])) {\n    plot_path &lt;- paste0(\"plots/\", .x, \"_histogram.png\")\n    png(plot_path)\n    hist(mtcars[[.x]], main = paste(\"Histogram of\", .x), xlab = .x)\n    dev.off()\n  }\n})\n\n\n\nmtcars histogram\n\n\nIn this example:\n\nWe create a directory called “plots”.\nWe use walk to iterate over the names of the mtcars dataset.\nFor each numeric column, we save a histogram to a PNG file.\n\nThis is a practical demonstration of how walk can be used for side-effect operations such as saving files.\n\n\n\nWhy Do We Need modify Then?\nSometimes you need to tweak elements within a list or vector without completely transforming them. This is where modify functions come in handy. They allow you to make specific changes to elements while preserving the overall structure of your data.\n\nmodify\nThe modify function applies a transformation to each element of a list or vector and returns the modified list or vector.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# A list of numbers\nnumbers &lt;- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Add 10 to each number\nmodified_numbers &lt;- modify(numbers, ~ .x + 10)\nmodified_numbers\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 11\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 12\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 13\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 14\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 15\nIn this example, modify adds 10 to each element of the numbers list.\n\n\nmodify_if\nmodify_if is used to conditionally modify elements that meet a specified condition (predicate).\n# Modify only the even numbers by multiplying them by 2\nmodified_if &lt;- modify_if(numbers, ~ .x %% 2 == 0, ~ .x * 2)\nmodified_if\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 3\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 8\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 5\nHere, modify_if multiplies only the even numbers by 2.\n\n\nmodify_at\nmodify_at allows you to specify which elements to modify based on their indices or names.\n# A named list of mixed types\nnamed_list &lt;- list(a = 1, b = \"hello\", c = 3, d = \"world\")\n\n# Convert only the specified elements to uppercase\nmodified_at &lt;- modify_at(named_list, c(\"b\", \"d\"), ~ toupper(.x))\nmodified_at\n\n$a\n[1] 1\n\n$b\n[1] \"HELLO\"\n\n$c\n[1] 3\n\n$d\n[1] \"WORLD\"\nIn this example, modify_at converts the specified character elements to uppercase.\n\n\nmodify with Built-in Dataset\nLet’s use the iris dataset to demonstrate how modify functions can be applied in a practical scenario. Suppose we want to normalize numeric columns by dividing each value by the maximum value in its column.\n# Normalizing numeric columns in the iris dataset\nnormalized_iris &lt;- iris %&gt;%\n  modify_at(vars(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width), \n            ~ .x / max(.x))\n\nhead(normalized_iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1    0.6455696   0.7954545    0.2028986        0.08  setosa\n2    0.6202532   0.6818182    0.2028986        0.08  setosa\n3    0.5949367   0.7272727    0.1884058        0.08  setosa\n4    0.5822785   0.7045455    0.2173913        0.08  setosa\n5    0.6329114   0.8181818    0.2028986        0.08  setosa\n6    0.6835443   0.8863636    0.2463768        0.16  setosa\n\nhead(iris)\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\nIn this example:\n\nWe use modify_at to specify the numeric columns of the iris dataset.\nEach value in these columns is divided by the maximum value in its respective column, normalizing the data.\n\nmodify functions offer a powerful way to make targeted changes to your data, providing flexibility and control.\n\n\n\nPredicates: Does Data Satisfy Our Assumptions? every, some, and none\nWhen working with data, it’s often necessary to check if certain conditions hold across elements in a list or vector. This is where predicate functions like every, some, and none come in handy. These functions help you verify whether elements meet specified criteria, making your data validation tasks easier and more expressive.\n\nevery\nThe every function checks if all elements in a list or vector satisfy a given predicate. If all elements meet the condition, it returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# A list of numbers\nnumbers &lt;- list(2, 4, 6, 8)\n\n# Check if all numbers are even\nall_even &lt;- every(numbers, ~ .x %% 2 == 0)\nall_even\n\n[1] TRUE\nIn this example, every checks if all elements in the numbers list are even.\n\n\nsome\nThe some function checks if at least one element in a list or vector satisfies a given predicate. If any element meets the condition, it returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE.\n# Check if any number is greater than 5\nany_greater_than_five &lt;- some(numbers, ~ .x &gt; 5)\nany_greater_than_five\n\n[1] TRUE\nHere, some checks if any element in the numbers list is greater than 5.\n\n\nnone\nThe none function checks if no elements in a list or vector satisfy a given predicate. If no elements meet the condition, it returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE.\n# Check if no number is odd\nnone_odd &lt;- none(numbers, ~ .x %% 2 != 0)\nnone_odd\n\n[1] TRUE\nIn this example, none checks if no elements in the numbers list are odd.\n\n\nPractical Example with Built-in Dataset\nLet’s use the mtcars dataset to demonstrate how these predicate functions can be applied in a practical scenario. Suppose we want to check various conditions on the columns of this dataset.\n# Check if all cars have more than 10 miles per gallon (mpg)\nall_mpg_above_10 &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n  select(mpg) %&gt;%\n  map_lgl(~ every(.x, ~ .x &gt; 10))\nall_mpg_above_10\n\nmpg\nTRUE\n\n# Check if some cars have more than 150 horsepower (hp)\nsome_hp_above_150 &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n  select(hp) %&gt;%\n  map_lgl(~ some(.x, ~ .x &gt; 150))\nsome_hp_above_150\n\nhp\nTRUE\n\n# Check if no car has more than 8 cylinders\nnone_cyl_above_8 &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n  select(cyl) %&gt;%\n  map_lgl(~ none(.x, ~ .x &gt; 8))\nnone_cyl_above_8\n\ncyl\nTRUE\nIn this example:\n\nWe check if all cars in the mtcars dataset have more than 10 mpg using every.\nWe check if some cars have more than 150 horsepower using some.\nWe check if no car has more than 8 cylinders using none.\n\nThese predicate functions provide a straightforward way to validate your data against specific conditions, making your analysis more robust.\n\n\n\nWhat If Not: keep and discard\nWhen you’re working with lists or vectors, you often need to filter elements based on certain conditions. The keep and discard functions from purrr are designed for this purpose. They allow you to retain or remove elements that meet specified criteria, making it easy to clean and subset your data.\n\nkeep\nThe keep function retains elements that satisfy a given predicate. If an element meets the condition, it is kept; otherwise, it is removed.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# A list of mixed numbers\nnumbers &lt;- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\n\n# Keep only the even numbers\neven_numbers &lt;- keep(numbers, ~ .x %% 2 == 0)\neven_numbers\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 2\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 6\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 8\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 10\nIn this example, keep retains only the even numbers from the numbers list.\n\n\ndiscard\nThe discard function removes elements that satisfy a given predicate. If an element meets the condition, it is discarded; otherwise, it is kept.\n# Discard the even numbers\nodd_numbers &lt;- discard(numbers, ~ .x %% 2 == 0)\nodd_numbers\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 3\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 5\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 7\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 9\nHere, discard removes the even numbers, leaving only the odd numbers in the numbers list.\n\n\n\nPractical Example with Built-in Dataset\nLet’s use the iris dataset to demonstrate how keep and discard can be applied in a practical scenario. Suppose we want to filter rows based on specific conditions for the Sepal.Length column.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Keep rows where Sepal.Length is greater than 5.0\niris_keep &lt;- iris %&gt;%\n  split(1:nrow(.)) %&gt;%\n  keep(~ .x$Sepal.Length &gt; 5.0) %&gt;%\n  bind_rows()\nhead(iris_keep)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n3          5.4         3.7          1.5         0.2  setosa\n4          5.8         4.0          1.2         0.2  setosa\n5          5.7         4.4          1.5         0.4  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.3         0.4  setosa\n\n# Discard rows where Sepal.Length is less than or equal to 5.0\niris_discard &lt;- iris %&gt;%\n  split(1:nrow(.)) %&gt;%\n  discard(~ .x$Sepal.Length &lt;= 5.0) %&gt;%\n  bind_rows()\nhead(iris_discard)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n3          5.4         3.7          1.5         0.2  setosa\n4          5.8         4.0          1.2         0.2  setosa\n5          5.7         4.4          1.5         0.4  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.3         0.4  setosa\nIn this example:\n\nWe split the iris dataset into a list of rows.\nWe apply keep to retain rows where Sepal.Length is greater than 5.0.\nWe apply discard to remove rows where Sepal.Length is less than or equal to 5.0.\nFinally, we use bind_rows() to combine the list back into a data frame.\n\n\nCombining keep and discard with mtcars\nSimilarly, let’s fix the mtcars example:\n# Keep cars with mpg greater than 20 and discard cars with hp less than 100\nfiltered_cars &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n  split(1:nrow(.)) %&gt;%\n  keep(~ .x$mpg &gt; 20) %&gt;%\n  discard(~ .x$hp &lt; 100) %&gt;%\n  bind_rows()\n\nfiltered_cars\n\n                mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4      21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4     4\nMazda RX4 Wag  21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4     4\nHornet 4 Drive 21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3     1\nLotus Europa   30.4   4  95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90  1  1    5     2\nVolvo 142E     21.4   4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60  1  1    4     2\nIn this combined example:\n\nWe split the mtcars dataset into a list of rows.\nWe use keep to retain cars with mpg greater than 20.\nWe use discard to remove cars with hp less than 100.\nWe combine the filtered list back into a data frame using bind_rows().\n\n\n\n\nDo Things in Order of List/Vector: accumulate, reduce\nSometimes, you need to perform cumulative or sequential operations on your data. This is where accumulate and reduce come into play. These functions allow you to apply a function iteratively across elements of a list or vector, either accumulating results at each step or reducing the list to a single value.\n\naccumulate\nThe accumulate function applies a function iteratively to the elements of a list or vector and returns a list of intermediate results.\nLet’s start with a simple example:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# A list of numbers\nnumbers &lt;- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Cumulative sum of the numbers\ncumulative_sum &lt;- accumulate(numbers, `+`)\ncumulative_sum\n\n[1]  1  3  6 10 15\n\n\nreduce\nThe reduce function applies a function iteratively to reduce the elements of a list or vector to a single value.\nHere’s a basic example:\n# Sum of the numbers\ntotal_sum &lt;- reduce(numbers, `+`)\ntotal_sum\n\n[1] 15\n\n\nPractical Example with Built-in Dataset\nLet’s use the mtcars dataset to demonstrate how accumulate and reduce can be applied in a practical scenario.\nUsing accumulate with mtcars\nSuppose we want to calculate the cumulative sum of the miles per gallon (mpg) for each car.\n# Cumulative sum of mpg values\ncumulative_mpg &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n  pull(mpg) %&gt;%\n  accumulate(`+`)\ncumulative_mpg\n\n[1]  21.0  42.0  64.8  86.2 104.9 123.0 137.3 161.7 184.5 203.7 221.5 237.9 255.2 270.4 280.8 291.2 305.9 338.3 368.7\n[20] 402.6 424.1 439.6 454.8 468.1 487.3 514.6 540.6 571.0 586.8 606.5 621.5 642.9\nIn this example, accumulate gives us a cumulative sum of the mpg values for the cars in the mtcars dataset.\nUsing reduce with mtcars\nNow, let’s say we want to find the product of all mpg values:\n# Product of mpg values\nproduct_mpg &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n  pull(mpg) %&gt;%\n  reduce(`*`)\nproduct_mpg\n\n[1] 1.264241e+41\nIn this example, reduce calculates the product of all mpg values in the mtcars dataset.\n\n\n\nDo It Another Way: compose and negate\nCreating flexible and reusable functions is a hallmark of efficient programming. purrr provides tools like compose and negate to help you build and manipulate functions more effectively. These tools allow you to combine multiple functions into one or invert the logic of a predicate function.\n\ncompose\nThe compose function combines multiple functions into a single function that applies them sequentially. This can be incredibly useful for creating pipelines of operations.\nHere’s a basic example:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Define some simple functions\nadd1 &lt;- function(x) x + 1\nsquare &lt;- function(x) x * x\n\n# Compose them into a single function\nadd1_and_square &lt;- compose(square, add1)\n\n# Apply the composed function\nresult &lt;- add1_and_square(2)  # (2 + 1)^2 = 9\nresult\n\n[1] 9\nIn this example:\n\nWe define two simple functions: add1 and square.\nWe use compose to create a new function, add1_and_square, which first adds 1 to its input and then squares the result.\nWe apply the composed function to the number 2, yielding 9.\n\n\n\nPractical Example with Built-in Dataset\nLet’s use compose with a more practical example involving the mtcars dataset. Suppose we want to create a function that first scales the horsepower (hp) by 10 and then calculates the logarithm.\n# Define scaling and log functions\nscale_by_10 &lt;- function(x) x * 10\nsafe_log &lt;- safely(log, otherwise = NA)\n\n# Compose them into a single function\nscale_and_log &lt;- compose(safe_log, scale_by_10)\n\n# Apply the composed function to the hp column\nmtcars &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n  mutate(log_scaled_hp = map_dbl(hp, ~ scale_and_log(.x)$result))\n\nhead(mtcars)\n\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb log_scaled_hp\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4     4      7.003065\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4     4      7.003065\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4     1      6.835185\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3     1      7.003065\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3     2      7.467371\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3     1      6.956545\nIn this example:\n\nWe define two functions: scale_by_10 and safe_log.\nWe compose these functions into scale_and_log.\nWe apply the composed function to the hp column of the mtcars dataset and add the results as a new column.\n\n\n\nnegate\nThe negate function creates a new function that returns the logical negation of a predicate function. This is useful when you want to invert the logic of a condition.\nHere’s a simple example:\n# Define a simple predicate function\nis_even &lt;- function(x) x %% 2 == 0\n\n# Negate the predicate function\nis_odd &lt;- negate(is_even)\n\n# Apply the negated function\nresults &lt;- map_lgl(1:10, is_odd)\nresults\n\n [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\nIn this example:\n\nWe define a predicate function is_even to check if a number is even.\nWe use negate to create a new function is_odd that returns the opposite result.\nWe apply is_odd to the numbers 1 through 10.\n\n\n\nPractical Example with Built-in Dataset\nLet’s use negate in a practical scenario with the iris dataset. Suppose we want to filter out rows where the Sepal.Length is not greater than 5.0.\n# Define a predicate function\nis_long_sepal &lt;- function(x) x &gt; 5.0\n\n# Negate the predicate function\nis_not_long_sepal &lt;- negate(is_long_sepal)\n\n# Filter out rows where Sepal.Length is not greater than 5.0\niris_filtered &lt;- iris %&gt;%\n  split(1:nrow(.)) %&gt;%\n  discard(~ is_not_long_sepal(.x$Sepal.Length)) %&gt;%\n  bind_rows()\n\nhead(iris_filtered)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n3          5.4         3.7          1.5         0.2  setosa\n4          5.8         4.0          1.2         0.2  setosa\n5          5.7         4.4          1.5         0.4  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.3         0.4  setosa\nIn this example:\n\nWe define a predicate function is_long_sepal to check if Sepal.Length is greater than 5.0.\nWe use negate to create a new function is_not_long_sepal that returns the opposite result.\nWe use discard to remove rows where Sepal.Length is not greater than 5.0, then combine the filtered list back into a data frame.\n\nWith compose and negate, you can create more flexible and powerful functions, allowing for more concise and readable code.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nCongratulations! You’ve journeyed through the world of purrr, mastering a wide array of functions and techniques to manipulate and transform your data. From basic mapping to creating powerful function compositions, purrr equips you with tools to make your data wrangling tasks more efficient and expressive.\nWhether you’re applying functions conditionally, dealing with side effects, or validating your data, purrr has you covered. Keep exploring and experimenting with these functions to unlock the full potential of functional programming in R.\n\n\nGift for patient readers\nI decided to give you some useful, yet not trivial use cases of purrr functions.\n\nDefine list of function to apply on data\napply_funs &lt;- function(x, ...) purrr::map_dbl(list(...), ~ .x(x))\nWant to apply multiple functions to a single vector and get a tidy result? Meet apply_funs, your new best friend! This nifty little function takes a value and a bunch of functions, then maps each function to the vector, returning the results as a neat vector.\nLet’s break it down:\n\nx: The value you want to transform.\n...: A bunch of functions you want to apply to x.\npurrr::map_dbl: Maps each function in the list to x and returns the results as a vector of doubles.\n\nSuppose that you want to apply 3 summary functions on vector of numbers. Here’s how you can do it:\nnumber &lt;- 1:48\n\nresults &lt;- apply_funs(number, mean, median, sd)\nresults\n\n[1] 24.5 24.5 14.0\n\n\nUsing pmap as equivalent of Python’s zip\nSometimes you need to zip two tables or columns together. In Python there is zip function for it, but we do not have twin function in R, unless you use pmap. I will not make it longer, so check it out in one of my previous articles.\n\n\nRendering parameterized RMarkdown reports\nAssuming that you have kind of report you use for each salesperson, there is possibility, that you are changing parameters manually to generate report for person X, for date range Y, for product Z. Why not prepare lists of people, time range, and list of products, and then based on them generate series of reports by one click only."
