### The Foundation with `ggplot2` {#61cd}

At the heart of our data visualization arsenal lies `ggplot2`, a package that has revolutionized the way we think about and create graphics in R. Inspired by Leland Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics, `ggplot2` allows users to assemble plots layer by layer, making the creation of complex visualizations both intuitive and accessible.

`ggplot2` shines in its ability to break down and understand data visualization as a series of logical steps: data selection, aesthetic mapping, geometric objects, and statistical transformations. This structured approach enables users to craft nearly any type of graphic, from simple scatter plots to intricate layered visualizations. The package's extensive customization options---through scales, themes, and coordinates---further empower users to tailor their visuals to the precise narrative they wish to convey.

For reports in Quarto or R Markdown, `ggplot2` acts as the foundational tool for data visualization. Its versatility is unmatched, offering crisp, publication-quality graphics for static outputs (PDF, DOCX) and adaptable visuals for dynamic HTML documents. Whether you're creating a formal report, a comprehensive academic paper, or an engaging web article, `ggplot2` provides the necessary tools to visually articulate your data's story.

To illustrate the power of `ggplot2`, let's create a simple yet elegant scatter plot:

```r
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data
df <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = rnorm(100)
)

# Scatter plot
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point(color = 'blue') +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Sample Scatter Plot") +
  xlab("X-axis Label") +
  ylab("Y-axis Label")
```

![Sample Scatter Plot](images/sample-scatter-plot.png)

This code snippet highlights `ggplot2`'s simplicity and elegance, creating a plot that is both visually appealing and informative. As we proceed to explore more specialized packages, `ggplot2` remains our trusted foundation, enabling us to build upon it and enhance our reports with diverse visual narratives.

In the dynamic world of web-based reporting, `plotly` stands out as a beacon of interactivity. It builds upon the static beauty of `ggplot2` plots by adding a layer of engagement through interactive elements. Users can hover over data points, zoom in on areas of interest, and filter through datasets directly within their plots, transforming a static visualization into an interactive exploration.

`plotly` offers a wide range of interactive chart types, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and more, all with the added benefit of user interaction. It's particularly adept at handling large datasets, making it possible to explore and interpret complex data in real-time. The package's ability to integrate with `ggplot2` means that users can easily elevate their existing visualizations from static to dynamic with minimal effort.

For HTML reports created in Quarto or R Markdown, `plotly` enhances the reader's experience by making the data exploration an integral part of the narrative. This level of interactivity invites the audience to engage with the data on a deeper level, facilitating a more personalized exploration of the findings. It's especially useful in scenarios where understanding data nuances is crucial, such as in exploratory data analysis or when presenting results to a diverse audience.

Here's how to transform a `ggplot2` plot into an interactive `plotly` plot:

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

# Create a ggplot
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(text = rownames(mtcars)), size = 4) +
  labs(title = "Motor Trend Car Road Tests",
       x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
       y = "Miles/(US) gallon") +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert to plotly
ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text")
```

This code demonstrates the ease with which a static `ggplot2` visualization can be converted into an interactive `plotly` graph. By incorporating `plotly` into your data storytelling toolkit, you unlock a world where data visualizations are not just seen but experienced.

### Mapping Data with `leaflet` {#c99a}

Geospatial data visualization is a critical aspect of storytelling in many fields, from environmental science to urban planning. `leaflet` for R brings the power of interactive mapping to your reports, allowing you to create detailed, dynamic maps that can be embedded directly into HTML documents. Based on the Leaflet.js library, it is the premier tool for building interactive maps in the R ecosystem.

With `leaflet`, you can layer multiple data sources on a single map, customize map appearances, and add interactive features like pop-ups and markers. It supports various map types, including base maps from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Google Maps. Whether you're tracking migration patterns, visualizing climate change data, or showcasing demographic trends, `leaflet` makes geospatial data accessible and engaging.

For Quarto or R Markdown reports destined for the web, `leaflet` maps offer a dynamic way to present geospatial data. Unlike static maps, `leaflet` enables readers to zoom in and out, explore different layers, and interact with the data points directly. This interactivity enhances the user's engagement and understanding, making `leaflet` an invaluable tool for reports that include location-based analysis or findings.

Creating an interactive map with `leaflet` is straightforward:

```r
library(leaflet)

# Sample data: Locations of some major cities
cities <- data.frame(
  lon = c(-74.00597, -0.127758, 151.20732),
  lat = c(40.71278, 51.50735, -33.86785),
  city = c("New York", "London", "Sydney")
)

# Create a leaflet map
leaflet(cities) %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(~lon, ~lat, popup = ~city)
```

![Interactive Map](images/interactive-map.png)

This example demonstrates how to create a basic interactive map showing specific locations. With `leaflet`, the complexity and depth of your geospatial visualizations are limited only by your imagination.

### Interactive Tables with `DT` {#2499}

In the realm of data presentation, tables are indispensable for displaying detailed information in a structured manner. `DT` (DataTables) is an R package that integrates the jQuery DataTables plugin, transforming static tables into interactive exploration tools. It enables users to search, sort, and paginate tables directly within HTML reports, enhancing the user's ability to engage with and understand the data.

`DT` offers a plethora of features to make tables more interactive and user-friendly. Highlights include automatic or custom column filtering, options for table styling, and the ability to include buttons for exporting the table to CSV, Excel, or PDF formats. These functionalities are particularly useful in reports that contain large datasets, allowing readers to navigate and focus on the data that interests them most.

For reports generated in Quarto or R Markdown with an HTML output, `DT` provides a superior way to present tabular data. It bridges the gap between static tables, which can be overwhelming and difficult to navigate, and the need for dynamic, accessible data presentation. Whether you're summarizing survey results, financial data, or scientific measurements, `DT` tables can significantly improve the readability and usability of your reports.

Here's a simple example of how to create an interactive table with `DT`:

```r
library(DT)

# Sample data: A subset of the mtcars dataset
data(mtcars)
mtcars_subset <- head(mtcars, 10)

# Render an interactive table
datatable(mtcars_subset, options = list(pageLength = 5, autoWidth = TRUE))
```

![Interactive Table](images/interactive-table.png)

This code snippet demonstrates how to convert a subset of the `mtcars` dataset into an interactive table, complete with pagination and adjustable column widths. By integrating `DT` into your reporting toolkit, you can ensure that even the densest data tables become navigable and insightful components of your narrative.

### The Grammar of Tables with `gt` {#6a86}

While `DT` focuses on interactivity for data tables, the `gt` package brings unparalleled levels of customization and styling to table creation in R. Standing for "Grammar of Tables," `gt` allows you to create highly detailed and beautifully formatted tables that communicate information clearly and effectively, akin to how `ggplot2` revolutionizes plot creation.

`gt` enables you to craft tables that go beyond mere data presentation; it allows you to tell a story with your data. From adding footnotes, coloring cells based on values, to creating complex layouts with grouped headers and spanning labels, `gt` provides a comprehensive suite of tools for enhancing the aesthetic and functional aspects of tables in your reports.

In Quarto or R Markdown reports, regardless of the output format (HTML, PDF, or DOCX), `gt` tables can significantly elevate the visual standard and readability of your presentations. Especially in PDFs and printed documents, where interactive elements are not feasible, the detailed customization `gt` offers makes your tables not just data containers but key narrative elements of your report.

To demonstrate the capabilities of `gt`, let's create a simple yet styled table using a subset of the `mtcars` dataset:

```r
library(gt)

# Sample data: A subset of the mtcars dataset
data <- head(mtcars, 10)

gt_table <- gt(data) %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Motor Trend Car Road Tests",
    subtitle = "A subset of the mtcars dataset"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    mpg = "Miles/(US) gallon",
    cyl = "Number of Cylinders",
    disp = "Displacement (cu.in.)"
  ) %>%
  fmt_number(
    columns = vars(mpg, disp),
    decimals = 2
  ) %>%
  tab_style(
    style = cell_fill(color = "gray"),
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "white"),
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = TRUE)
  )

gt_table
```

![Styled Table](images/styled-table.png)

This code snippet highlights how `gt` not only allows for the structuring and presentation of tabular data but also for the artistic expression within data reporting, making your tables both informative and visually appealing.

### Bringing Plots to Life with `ggiraph` {#ab7b}

In the quest to make reports more engaging, `ggiraph` emerges as a powerful ally, enabling the transformation of static `ggplot2` graphics into interactive visual stories. `ggiraph` allows elements within `ggplot2` plots, such as points, lines, and bars, to become interactive, supporting tooltips, hover actions, and even hyperlinks. This interactivity enriches the user experience, allowing for a deeper exploration and understanding of the underlying data.

The `ggiraph` package shines when you want to add a layer of engagement to your data visualizations. With it, viewers can hover over specific elements to see more details or click on parts of the graph to access external resources. This capability is invaluable for online reports, where reader engagement and interactivity are paramount.

For HTML-based reports created with Quarto or R Markdown, `ggiraph` enhances the storytelling potential by making data visualizations a two-way interaction channel. This feature is especially useful for exploratory data analysis, educational materials, or any report aiming to provide an immersive data exploration experience. While `ggiraph` excels in web environments, the static versions of these enriched plots still retain their aesthetic and informational value in PDF or DOCX outputs.

Here's a basic example of how to create an interactive plot with `ggiraph`, making use of a simple `ggplot2` bar chart:

```r
# Example taken from https://www.productive-r-workflow.com/quarto-tricks#ggiraph
# It was too good not to share it with you.
# You can find more Quatro tricks on this site. 

library(ggplot2)
library(ggiraph)
library(patchwork)

# Example data - replace with your data
map_data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:3,
  lat = c(40, 42, 37),
  lon = c(-100, -120, -95),
  group = c("A", "B", "C")
)

line_data <- data.frame(
  id = rep(1:3, each = 10),
  time = rep(seq(as.Date("2021-01-01"), by = "1 month", length.out = 10), 3),
  value = rnorm(30),
  group = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)
)

# Map with interactive points
map_plot <- ggplot() +
  borders("world", colour = "gray80", fill = "gray90") +  # Add a world map background
  geom_point_interactive(data = map_data, aes(x = lon, y = lat, size = 5, color=group, tooltip = group, data_id = group)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-130, -65), ylim = c(10, 75)) 


# Line chart with interactive lines
line_plot <- ggplot(line_data, aes(x = time, y = value, group = group, color=group)) +
  geom_line_interactive(aes(data_id = group, tooltip = group))

combined_plot <- girafe(
  ggobj = map_plot + plot_spacer() + line_plot + plot_layout(widths = c(0.35, 0, 0.65)),
  options = list(
    opts_hover(css = ''),
    opts_hover_inv(css = "opacity:0.1;"), 
    opts_sizing(rescale = FALSE)
  ),
  height_svg = 4,
  width_svg = 12
)
```

![Interactive Plot](images/interactive-plot.png)

This example assumes a scenario where clicking on a point on the map would dynamically highlight the corresponding line on the line chart on the left. As you see, the alpha of lines for categories that are not pointed decreases to emphasize the clicked one.

### Seamless Plot Compositions with `patchwork` {#5a21}

While `ggiraph` brings individual plots to life with interactivity, `patchwork` is the tool for harmoniously combining multiple `ggplot2` plots into a cohesive composition. `patchwork` simplifies the process of arranging multiple plots, allowing for complex layouts that maintain a unified aesthetic. It's akin to assembling a visual symphony from individual notes, where each plot plays its part in the overarching data narrative.

`patchwork` excels in its flexibility and ease of use, offering a syntax that is both intuitive and powerful. It allows for the vertical, horizontal, and nested arrangement of plots, and gives you control over spacing, alignment, and even shared legends. This capability is invaluable when you need to compare different aspects of your data side by side or tell a multi-faceted story through a series of visualizations.

In both Quarto and R Markdown reports, regardless of the output format, `patchwork` enables you to create visually appealing and informative plot arrangements. For static reports (PDF, DOCX), these compositions can help convey complex information in a digestible format. For HTML reports, while `patchwork` does not add interactivity to the plots themselves, the strategic arrangement of visual elements can guide the reader's exploration of the data.

To demonstrate the power of `patchwork`, let's create a composition of two simple `ggplot2` plots:

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

# First plot: A scatter plot
p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = cyl)) + 
  labs(title = "Displacement vs. MPG")

# Second plot: A bar plot
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(cyl))) + 
  labs(title = "Cylinder Count")

# Combine the plots with patchwork
plot_combo <- p1 + p2 + 
  plot_layout(ncol = 1, heights = c(1, 1)) +
  plot_annotation(title = "Vehicle Characteristics")

# Display the combined plot
plot_combo
```

![Combined Plot](images/combined-plot.png)

This example illustrates how `patchwork` seamlessly combines two distinct `ggplot2` plots into a single, coherent visual statement. By arranging plots in a thoughtfully designed layout, you can enhance the storytelling impact of your data visualizations in reports.
