-   **Matching Brackets and Quotes**: RStudio automatically adds the closing parenthesis, square bracket, curly brace, or quote whenever you type the opening one, ensuring your code stays balanced.

#### Rainbow Brackets: Code Clarity at a Glance

For nested code, the **rainbow parentheses** feature visually matches brackets with different colors. This simple yet powerful tool prevents confusion in deeply nested structures, like loops or conditional statements. You can enable this feature by going to Code menu and checking "Rainbow parentheses."

#### GitHub Copilot: Your AI-Powered Coding Assistant

GitHub Copilot takes autocomplete to a whole new level by leveraging AI to suggest complete lines or even entire blocks of code as you type. It works by analyzing the context of your script and predicting what you're likely to write next, drawing from its training on vast amounts of publicly available code.

Here’s how it works in RStudio:

1.  **Installation**: Install the GitHub Copilot extension for your IDE (RStudio support requires using Visual Studio Code or an appropriate setup with RStudio integrations).

2.  **Contextual Suggestions**: As you start typing, Copilot analyzes your code and presents inline suggestions. For example:

    -   If you write `library(ggplot2)` and start a plot with `ggplot(data, aes`, Copilot may suggest the rest of the `ggplot` syntax based on common patterns.

    -   Typing `for (i in 1:n)` might prompt a complete loop structure with placeholders for customization.

3.  **Acceptance and Editing**: Press **Tab** to accept a suggestion or keep typing to refine it. If multiple suggestions are available, Copilot allows you to cycle through options.

4.  **Custom Functionality**: Start writing a function or algorithm, and Copilot will attempt to complete it. For example, typing a comment like `# Function to calculate Fibonacci numbers` could prompt a complete function implementation.

By streamlining repetitive tasks, reducing syntax errors, and even providing inspiration for tackling coding challenges, GitHub Copilot transforms coding into a collaborative experience. It’s especially useful when you're exploring new techniques or working with unfamiliar libraries.

### Multi-Cursor Editing: One Action, Multiple Changes

When working with repetitive tasks, multi-cursor editing can save you significant time by allowing you to make simultaneous edits in multiple places. This feature is particularly helpful when renaming variables, adding repetitive structures, or formatting several lines of code at once.

1.  **Add Multiple Cursors**:

    -   Press **Ctrl + Alt + Click** (Windows) or **Cmd + Option + Click** (Mac) to place additional cursors wherever you need them.

2.  **Bulk Edits**:

    -   Once you have multiple cursors, you can type, delete, or paste code simultaneously in all selected spots.

    -   For example, if you need to change a variable name across several lines, place cursors at each instance of the variable and type the new name to update them all at once.

3.  **Column Editing**:

    -   Select a block of text and press **Shift + Alt** while dragging vertically to create a multi-cursor selection aligned to specific columns.

This functionality eliminates the need to make changes line by line, saving you from repetitive tasks and allowing you to focus on more complex parts of your code.
