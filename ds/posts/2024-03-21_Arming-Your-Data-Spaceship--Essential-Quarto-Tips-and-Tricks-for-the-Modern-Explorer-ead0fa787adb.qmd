Let's start an adventure of discovering functionalities available in Quarto, that can change a way we work.

## Creating Tabs in Quarto HTML Output

### Preparing for Lift-Off in RStudio

Before we embark, ensure your RStudio is updated and Quarto is installed. Begin by launching RStudio and creating a new Quarto document:

1. Go to `File` > `New File` > `Quarto Document` > `HTML`.
2. Save your new file with a meaningful name, such as `stellar-tabs.qmd`.

### Step 1: Charting the Tabs

Quarto uses simple markdown enhancements to create tabs, allowing you to neatly package diverse content types under individual headings within your HTML document. To initiate your tabbed content, follow this structure:

```markdown
::: {.panel-tabset}

# Galaxy Exploration

This tab might contain an overview of your data exploration endeavors, perhaps some narrative on the galaxies you've charted.

# Star Analysis

Here, delve into the analysis of star compositions. This could be an excellent place for a visual plot or detailed statistical breakdown.

# Planetary Data

In this tab, present your findings on various planets. Interactive charts or data tables could be particularly illuminating here.

:::
```

In this syntax, `::: {.panel-tabset}` denotes the beginning of the tabbed section, and `:::` indicates its end. Each heading (`#`) represents a new tab, with the content following it populating that tab.

### Step 2: Embedding Cosmic Content

Tabs can contain a vast array of content types, from textual narratives to dynamic visualizations. For example, to include a plot using R within one of your tabs, simply insert an R code chunk as you normally would:

````markdown
<!-- inside the structure from last chunk -->

# Nebulae Visualization

Visualizing the intricate structures of various nebulae encountered.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(nebulae_data, aes(x=position, y=light_intensity)) + geom_point()
```
````

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UXdFO--VQEwVs_dxn8bkSA.png)

This code chunk, placed within a tab, seamlessly integrates an R-generated plot into your tabbed document structure.

### Step 3: Launching Your Document

With your document structured and content in place, it's time to compile and preview your work:

- Click the `Render` button in RStudio to transform your `.qmd` file into a polished HTML document.
- Upon rendering, RStudio will automatically open a preview of your document, showcasing your neatly organized tabs filled with rich content.

## Illuminating the Cosmos: Interactive Visualizations with `ggiraph` in Quarto

### Preparing Your Spacecraft: Installing `ggiraph`

Before embarking on our journey to create interactive visualizations, ensure your Quarto environment is ready and equipped with the `ggiraph` package. Launch RStudio, open your Quarto document, and prepare to install `ggiraph` if you haven't already:

```bash
# Install ggiraph package
install.packages("ggiraph")
```

### Crafting Interactive Constellations

The `ggiraph` package enhances `ggplot2` visualizations by making them interactive. You can add tooltips, clickable actions, and hover effects, transforming static plots into engaging experiences. Let's create a simple interactive plot:

1. **Load Necessary Libraries**: Begin by loading the `ggplot2` and `ggiraph` packages in your Quarto document.

````r
```{r setup, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggiraph)
```
````

2. **Create a ggplot Object**: Craft your plot using `ggplot2`, as you typically would. For this example, let's visualize the `mtcars` dataset:

````r
```{r echo = FALSE}
# Create a ggplot object
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, tooltip = paste("Weight:", wt, "MPG:", mpg), data_id = row.names(mtcars))) +
  geom_point_interactive()
```
````

Notice the use of `geom_point_interactive()` instead of the usual `geom_point()`. This is where `ggiraph` works its magic, making the points interactive with `tooltip` and `data_id` arguments.

3. **Render the Interactive Plot**: Use the `girafe()` function from `ggiraph` to render your interactive plot within the Quarto document.

````r
```{r echo = FALSE}
girafe(ggobj = p)
```
````

### Navigating Through Interactive Nebulae

With your interactive plot rendered, viewers can now hover over data points to see tooltips --- snippets of information that provide deeper insights into each point. This level of interaction invites the audience to explore the data more closely, fostering a connection and understanding that static plots cannot achieve.

### Expanding Your Universe

The example above scratches the surface of what's possible with `ggiraph` in Quarto. The package supports a variety of interactive geoms and options, allowing you to tailor the interactivity to your needs. Explore `geom_bar_interactive()`, `geom_line_interactive()`, and more to discover the full potential of interactive visualizations in your Quarto documents.

### The Cosmos Awaits

Integrating `ggiraph` into your Quarto documents opens up new galaxies of possibilities for data visualization and storytelling. As we continue our exploration of Quarto's capabilities, let this chapter on `ggiraph` remind us that the power to illuminate the cosmos lies within our grasp. By making our data visualizations interactive, we not only enhance the aesthetic appeal of our documents but also deepen the engagement and understanding of our audience.

```{mermaid}
graph TD;
    A[Data Exploration] -->|Transform| B(Data Modeling);
    B --> C{Insight Discovery};
    C -->|Yes| D[Communicate Results];
    C -->|No| E[Iterate Further];
```
````

Similarly, for Graphviz diagrams, encapsulate your Graphviz code within a fenced code block annotated with `graphviz`:

````markdown
```{dot}
digraph G {
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
    C -> D;
    D -> A;
}
```
````
