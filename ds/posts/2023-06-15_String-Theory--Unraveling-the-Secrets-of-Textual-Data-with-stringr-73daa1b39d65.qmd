**Pattern Matching with `str_extract()`:**

Stringr offers a powerful function called `str_extract()` that allows us to locate and extract specific patterns or substrings from our text. Think of it as a cosmic magnifying glass, enabling us to zoom in on the precise elements we seek within the vastness of textual data.

For example, let's say we have a dataset of customer reviews, and we want to extract all the email addresses mentioned within those reviews. With `str_extract()`, we can easily accomplish this task:

``` r
library(stringr) 

# Example customer reviews
customer_reviews <- c("Great product! Email me at example@gmail.com for further inquiries.", "Contact us via support@example.com for any assistance.")

# Extract email addresses from customer reviews
email_addresses <- str_extract(customer_reviews, "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\\b")

email_addresses
# [1] "example@gmail.com"   "support@example.com"
```

In this code snippet, we use `str_extract()` along with a regular expression pattern to locate and extract email addresses from the customer reviews. The result is a vector containing the extracted email addresses, allowing us to analyze and utilize this information effectively.

**String Replacement with `str_replace()`:**

Sometimes, we encounter the need to replace specific patterns within our strings. `Stringr`'s `str_replace()` function comes to our rescue, acting as a cosmic tool for seamless string replacement.

Consider a scenario where we want to sanitize a dataset of tweets by replacing all instances of profanity with asterisks. Here's how we can accomplish this using `str_replace()`:

``` r
library(stringr) 
# Example tweets with bad word duck :D
tweets <- c("This movie is ducking amazing! #bestmovieever",
            "I can't believe how ducked the service was. #disappointed")

# Replace profanity with asterisks
sanitized_tweets <- str_replace(tweets, "\\bduck", "****")

sanitized_tweets
# [1] "This movie is ****ing amazing! #bestmovieever"            
# [2] "I can't believe how ****ed the service was. #disappointed"
```

The pattern is replaced with four asterisks, effectively censoring the profanity within the tweets.

**String Detection with `str_detect()`:**

Another useful function in `stringr`'s cosmic toolbox is `str_detect()`. This function allows us to detect the presence of specific substrings within our strings, enabling us to filter or perform conditional operations based on the detected patterns.

Suppose we have a dataset of customer feedback and want to identify which comments mention the word "excellent". We can achieve this using `str_detect()`:

``` r
library(stringr) 
# Example customer feedback
customer_feedback <- c("The service was excellent and the staff was friendly.",
"I had a terrible experience and won’t recommend this place.")

# Detect comments mentioning “excellent”
excellent_mentions <- str_detect(customer_feedback, "\\bexcellent\\b")

# [1]  TRUE FALSE
```

By using `str_detect()` with a regular expression pattern, we identify which comments contain the exact word "excellent". The result is a logical vector indicating the presence or absence of "excellent" mentions within each feedback entry.

With these examples, we catch a glimpse of `stringr`'s celestial power in manipulating, extracting, and detecting patterns within textual data. These functions serve as versatile instruments in the textual physicist's toolkit, allowing us to navigate the vast textual universe and derive insights from its interwoven strings.

# Extract important keywords from headlines
keywords <- str_extract(headlines, "\\b[A-Z][a-z]+\\b")

keywords
# [1] "Scientists" "Breaking"   "Tech"    
```

In this code snippet, the regular expression pattern (`\\b[A-Z][a-z]+\\b`) allows us to extract the important keywords from each headline by matching capitalized words. The resulting `keywords` vector provides us with a cosmic glimpse into the essence of each news headline.

**String Manipulation with Functions:**

`Stringr` provides a suite of functions that enable sophisticated string manipulation, allowing us to transform and reshape textual data. These functions act as cosmic tools for manipulating strings, enabling us to extract valuable insights from the vast cosmic web of textual information.

For instance, suppose we have a dataset of customer reviews, and we want to remove all punctuation marks to perform sentiment analysis. `Stringr`'s `str_remove_all()` function can help us achieve this:

``` r
library(stringr)
# Example customer reviews
reviews <- c("This product is amazing!", "Horrible customer service!!!", "I love it!!!")

# Remove punctuation marks from reviews
clean_reviews <- str_remove_all(reviews, "[[:punct:]]")

clean_reviews
# [1] "This product is amazing"   "Horrible customer service" "I love it" 
```

Using the regular expression pattern `[[:punct:]]`, `str_remove_all()` effectively removes all punctuation marks from the reviews. This cosmic transformation allows us to focus solely on the words and sentiments expressed in the customer feedback.

**Exploring Textual Boundaries with `str_split()`:**

In the cosmic realm of textual data, we often encounter the need to split strings based on specific delimiters or boundaries. `Stringr`'s `str_split()` function provides us with a cosmic compass to navigate these boundaries and extract valuable components from strings.

Imagine we have a dataset of email addresses, and we want to separate the username and domain name. We can effortlessly achieve this using `str_split()`:

``` r
library(stringr)
# Example email addresses
emails <- c("john.doe@example.com", "jane.smith@gmail.com", "mark.wilson@yahoo.com")

# Split email addresses into username and domain
split_emails <- str_split(emails, "@")
split_emails 

# [[1]]
# [1] "john.doe"    "example.com"

# [[2]]
# [1] "jane.smith" "gmail.com" 

# [[3]]
# [1] "mark.wilson" "yahoo.com" 
```

With `str_split()` and the delimiter `@`, we split each email address into two components --- the username and the domain. The resulting `split_emails` list provides us with a cosmic separation of these essential elements.
