### Understanding purrr: The Functional Programming Paradigm {#b31f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="b31f"}

To fully appreciate the `purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} package,
it's essential to understand the functional programming paradigm, which
serves as the foundation of `purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}'s
capabilities.

Functional programming is a programming approach that treats computation
as the evaluation of mathematical functions while avoiding changing
state and mutable data. This style of programming emphasizes the use of
pure functions, which are functions that, given the same input, will
always produce the same output without any side effects. Picture
functional programming like a composer, who brings together various
instruments, playing their individual parts in perfect harmony, to
create a unified and elegant piece of music.

Functional programming offers several benefits when working with R,
particularly for data analysis. Some of these advantages include:

1.  [Readability: Functional programming promotes writing clean and
    modular code, making it easier for others (and yourself) to
    understand and maintain the code. Think of it as a well-organized
    musical score, with each section clearly marked and easy to
    follow.]{#f38f}
2.  [Reusability: Pure functions can be easily reused across different
    parts of your code, as they don't rely on any external state. This
    reduces the need to write repetitive code and allows you to create a
    library of versatile functions, much like a conductor reusing
    musical motifs throughout a symphony.]{#cbe6}
3.  [Ease of debugging: By minimizing the use of mutable data and global
    state, functional programming reduces the likelihood of unexpected
    bugs, making the code more predictable and easier to debug. It's
    akin to a conductor being able to isolate and resolve any discordant
    notes within the orchestra.]{#a0b4}
4.  [Parallel processing: The absence of side effects in functional
    programming allows for more efficient parallel processing, enabling
    you to harness the full power of modern multi-core processors. It's
    like having multiple conductors working in perfect sync, seamlessly
    leading the orchestra in harmony.]{#6bef}

The `purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} package is designed to work
seamlessly with R's functional programming capabilities. One of its key
strengths lies in its ability to apply functions to elements within data
structures, such as lists and data frames. The package offers a range of
"map" functions that allow you to elegantly iterate over these
structures, transforming and manipulating the data as needed. This
powerful feature of `purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} serves as the
conductor's baton, guiding the flow of your data analysis and helping
you create a harmonious and efficient workflow.

In the following sections, we will explore `purrr`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code}'s key functions and demonstrate how they can help you
streamline your data analysis process in R.

### A Closer Look at purrr's Key Functions {#38aa .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="38aa"}

Now that we have a solid understanding of the functional programming
paradigm, let's dive into some of the key functions that the
`purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} package offers. These functions,
like a conductor's hand gestures, guide the flow of data through various
operations, ensuring an efficient and harmonious analysis.

**map() and its variants: Turning a caterpillar of code into a
butterfly**

The `map()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} function is the cornerstone
of the `purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} package, allowing you to
apply a function to each element of a list or vector. This versatile
function can simplify your code by replacing cumbersome for loops and
`lapply()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} calls with a more concise and
expressive syntax. The `map()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} function
comes in several variants, each tailored to return a specific type of
output, such as `map_lgl()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} for logical,
`map_chr()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} for character, and
`map_dbl()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} for double values. This
flexibility enables you to transform your code into a more elegant and
streamlined form, much like a caterpillar metamorphosing into a
beautiful butterfly.

**pmap(): Mastering multiple inputs like juggling balls**

The `pmap()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} function is designed to
handle multiple input lists or vectors, iterating over them in parallel
and applying a specified function. This powerful function allows you to
juggle multiple inputs effortlessly, enabling complex data manipulation
and transformation with ease. Like a skilled
juggler,` pmap()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} keeps all the input
"balls" in the air, ensuring that they're processed and combined as
intended.

**keep() and discard(): Handpicking data like sorting apples**

When you need to filter data based on specific criteria,
`purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}'s `keep()`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code} and `discard()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}
functions come to the rescue. `keep()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}
retains elements that meet a given condition, while
`discard()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} removes elements that meet
the condition. These functions let you handpick data elements as if you
were sorting apples, keeping the good ones and discarding the bad. With
their intuitive syntax and functional programming approach,
`keep()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} and `discard()`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code} make data filtering a breeze.

**reduce(): Folding data like origami**

The `reduce()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} function in purrr allows
you to successively apply a function to elements of a list or vector,
effectively "folding" the data like an intricate piece of origami. This
function is particularly useful when you need to aggregate data or
combine elements in a specific manner. By iteratively applying a
specified function, `reduce()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} skillfully
folds your data into the desired shape or form.

**safely(): Handling errors gracefully like a trapeze artist**

In data analysis, errors and unexpected situations can arise. The
`safely()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} function in purrr enables you
to handle these scenarios with grace and poise, much like a trapeze
artist performing a complex routine. `safely()`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code} takes a function as input and returns a new function
that, when applied, captures any errors and returns them as part of the
output, rather than halting the execution. This allows you to identify
and address errors without disrupting the flow of your analysis.

These key functions, along with many others in the `purrr`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code} package, provide a powerful toolkit for efficient and
harmonious data analysis in R. In the next sections, we'll explore how
to apply these functions to real-life data analysis tasks and

real-life data analysis tasks. By integrating `purrr `{.markup--code
.markup--p-code}into your workflow, you can master the art of data
analysis like a skilled conductor, guiding the flow of data through
various operations and producing harmonious results.

**Data transformation: Cleaning up a messy room**

Data transformation is an essential step in the data analysis process,
as real-world data can often be messy and unstructured. Using
`purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}'s `map()`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code} functions, you can easily apply cleaning and
transformation operations to your data, much like tidying up a cluttered
room. For example, you might use `map_chr()`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code} to extract specific information from text strings, or
`map_dbl()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} to convert data types within
a data frame. By applying these functions iteratively, you can transform
and reshape your data into a more structured and usable format.

**Data aggregation: Assembling a puzzle**

In many cases, you'll need to aggregate data from multiple sources or
perform complex calculations to derive insights. The
`reduce()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} function in purrr allows you
to combine data elements like puzzle pieces, iteratively applying a
function to merge or aggregate data as needed. Whether you're summing up
values, calculating averages, or performing custom aggregations,
`reduce()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} can help you assemble the data
puzzle and reveal the bigger picture.

**Data summarization: Condensing a novel into a short story**

Data summarization is the process of distilling large amounts of
information into concise, meaningful insights. Using
`purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}'s functional programming
approach, you can create custom summary functions that extract relevant
information from your data, much like condensing a novel into a short
story. By chaining together `map()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}
functions with other tidyverse tools, such as `dplyr`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code}'s `summarize()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} and
`mutate()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} functions, you can generate
insightful summaries that highlight the most important aspects of your
data.

**Iterative operations: Unraveling the threads of data**

Many data analysis tasks require performing iterative operations, such
as running simulations, fitting models, or processing data in chunks.
With purrr's `pmap()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} function, you can
effortlessly juggle multiple inputs and apply functions across them in
parallel. This enables you to unravel the threads of data, revealing
patterns and relationships that might otherwise remain hidden.
Additionally, by combining `purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}'s
functions with other R tools, such as parallel processing packages or
machine learning libraries, you can further enhance the efficiency and
power of your iterative operations.

In summary, `purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}'s functional
programming capabilities enable you to tackle a wide range of data
analysis tasks with elegance and efficiency. By integrating

### Case Study: Building Models and Creating Visualizations with purrr and Nested Data {#e16f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e16f"}

In R we usually have many function vectorized which mean that for
example they can be used on column of dataframe without using loop,
apply or map. Purrr's map functions can of course be used to apply
vectorized functions, but is too easy. Let me show you something little
bit harder and showing more of `purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}'s
capabilities.

In this case study, we will demonstrate how to use purrr with nested
data to build multiple models and create custom visualizations.

**Introducing the dataset: A collection of diverse species**

Imagine we have a dataset containing measurements of various iris
species, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal
width, as well as the species classification. Our goal is to create
separate linear regression models for each species to predict petal
length based on petal width and visualize the results.

**Data preparation: Nesting the data like a matryoshka doll**

To begin, we need to split the dataset by species and create a nested
data frame. We can use` dplyr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}'s
`group_by()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} and `tidyr`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code}'s `nest()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} functions for
this task:

``` {#cad2 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="2" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="r"}
library(tidyverse)
nested_data <- iris %>%
 group_by(Species) %>%
 nest()
```

This results in a nested data frame with one row for each species and a
nested column containing the data for each group.

**Model building: Crafting artisanal models for each species**

Now that our data is nested, we can use `purrr`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code}'s `map()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} function to
fit a linear regression model for each species:

``` {#3b55 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="2" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="r"}
model_data <- nested_data %>%
 mutate(models = map(data, ~lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = .x)))
```

This adds a new column to our data frame containing the fitted linear
regression models for each species.

**Model evaluation: Extracting golden nuggets of insight**

To evaluate the performance of our models, we can use purrr to calculate
performance metrics, such as the R-squared value, for each model:

``` {#8b46 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="2" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="r"}
model_data <- model_data %>%
 mutate(r_squared = map_dbl(models, ~summary(.x)$r.squared))
```

This adds a new column to our data frame with the R-squared value for
each species' model, allowing us to compare their performance.

**Visualization: Painting a vibrant portrait of species-specific
trends**

Finally, we can use `purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} and
`ggplot2`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} to create custom visualizations
for each species. We will create a scatter plot of petal length versus
petal width, along with the fitted regression line for each species:

``` {#2739 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="2" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="r"}
plot_data <- model_data %>%
 mutate(plots = map2(data, models, ~{
 ggplot(.x, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
 geom_point() +
 geom_abline(aes(intercept = coef(.y)[1], slope = coef(.y)[2]), color = 'blue') +
 ggtitle(paste('Species:', unique(Species))) +
 theme_minimal()
 }))
```

This adds a new column to our data frame containing a
`ggplot`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} object for each species. To
display the plots, we can use `purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}'s
`walk()`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} function:

``` {#abf8 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="2" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="r"}
walk(plot_data$plots, print)
```

This will display the three separate scatter plots with the fitted
regression lines, allowing us to visually compare the relationships
between petal length and petal width for each iris species.

In conclusion, this case study demonstrates how the
`purrr`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} package can be used to work with
nested data, fit multiple models, and create custom visualizations. By
leveraging the power of purrr and functional programming, you can
efficiently analyze complex datasets and gain valuable insights.
